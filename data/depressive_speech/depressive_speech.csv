There are more than twenty words for this thing:           *bety√°rk√∂rte, husz√°rk√∂rte, petern√°c, labanctall√©r, sz√°razszem√∂lcs, gatyazs√≠r, hunyormag, leg√©nytall√©r, mexik√≥i gomb√≥c, p√∂l√∂nc, sz≈ërmeggy, zsiv√°nyk√∂rte, csib√©sztall√©r, rabl√≥mazsola, csib√©szbors√≥, partiz√°ngoly√≥cska, zsiv√°nymazsola, husz√°rlep√©ny, cimborapog√°csa, csimasztall√©r, b√©ls√°rk√°nyfog, bety√°rgum√≥, seggcsimb√≥k, szarcsimb√≥k*         Now, what is the meaning of b√∂l√∂nc?

But this year, they changed it to a year-long course on a wide variety of topics.    Now the class is called Health and Wellness, and while it still covers the old topics like sex ed, it also covers topics like healthy relationships, depression, and how to deal with stress. Today we began a unit on stress relief, and what are healthy ways to take care of stress in your life.

I like to feed them after my walk since it's more convenient, but the past 2 days she's been expecting me before I even leave the house. And when I start walking she follows me.

When I asked her why it happened and if she had feelings for him, she said that she did for both him and I, and that she was confused.

I have no will to live at the moment, and I would honestly just end it all right now if I had the motivation to. I don‚Äôt see the point in being alive anymore.

I am going to do this for 30 minutes than this for 30 minutes, then take a little break, then this for 30 minutes and so on"" her reply was ""no I'm not doing that""  She tells she doesn't have enough time, but honestly half of the time on our breaks she just sits on her phone and does nothing, she eats at the other breaks.

30,"I was pleasantly surprised by Fortnite's Save the World (PvE) mode.... edit: I am* pleasantly surprised. ;-]   Thought I would post this here as I think the /r/FORTnITE subreddit would just be an echo chamber.  I played a bit of the Battle Royale mode that everyone's crazy about, but I could never see the fun in dying 99 times out of 100 (provided everyone is on the same skill level). Furthermore, there is just something so disappointing about building a fort, being killed a sniper that you couldn't even see far away, and having that fort vanish into the depths of instance hell.  On a whim, I decided to try out Save the World. I wasn't expecting such a cartoony shooter to have such fleshed out skill trees, crafting/building systems, and a wide array of diverse-looking characters. Unlike PvP, your forts actually matter for a longer amount of time, and in some cases, your base stays as it was when you built it in earlier quests.  A few hours in and I'm still in over my head trying to figure out keybinds and faster ways to build. This mode really is a hidden gem if you're into quick-paced base-building and horde-fighting. Once the whole game becomes free-to-play later this year, I can imagine a lot of players having fun in the PvE mode!  Anyone else try Save the World?",0,set2

My question is does anyone else ever feel like there getting something I've nick names music triggered nostalgia. Ok hear me out I know it's a bit wierd and cheesy. I used to read a lot when I was younger and alot of the time I was reading I was listening to music usually one while album through to the end. Usually I'd listen to the album more than once while reading the same book. I also used to just listen to music doing basically everything too.  So sometimes Spotify will throw out one of the songs of those albums and it's like someone flicks a light switch on or opens a door into the plot of that book or the scene or activity I was doing at the time.   It's very vivid and I can sometimes even picture the lines of the book and what I depicted the scene as.  So in short I'm asking is there anyone that knows anymore about this or experiences this.

Get up, watch Saturday cartoons. Mainly Superfriends was a favorite. Fast forward to afternoon. Ride my bike around with friends. Beyond backyard, there were woods. One time i went back there and found an abandoned graveyard. Another time i found a plastic garbage bag with old Playboys in it. After this if time allowed, I'd play with my Atari 2600. Pitfall or any Activision title. Again fast forward to night.  Watched anything from A-Team, Knight Rider, Airwolf.  Life was good.  And I miss the hell out of it",0,set2
64,"So, I pulled a ""stunt"" at work this week... First off, sorry about the throwaway account. I really want to spill my guts to all of you great strangers of the internet, but don't want to leave so much identifiable info about me and my job on my main account. Also, sorry for the novel.  Anyway, I work as a drafter at an engineering firm, and am the low man on the totem pole for the electrical department. I've learned a lot over my time at the company & the engineers I work under have slowly been giving me more and more design responsibility, particularly for easier things like laying out lighting and plugs and stuff.  So we recently got this project. Its a complete gut and remodel of a pretty large existing building & they asked me to do the existing conditions field survey since everyone else in the department was busy with other projects & the building in question was going to be a simple place to survey  (an empty building with few interior walls). I've done many field surveys before (usually they give me the easier ones like this), so it wasn't anything new for me.  The project itself is a pretty intense & will require completely new electrical everything, including a whole new electrical service. Thankfully, while its a very large project with lots of electrical work, we've been doing quite a few projects lately that are very similar to this one (albeit much smaller). Because of the similar projects, I have direct experience with (or at least a reference to) a majority of the design components in this project, with 1 huge exception... The electrical distribution.  While the engineers trust me to do many of the simpler tasks for them, I've never really had the opportunity to touch the electrical distribution before. The engineers have been really awesome, though, and often explain their designs (and their thought processes regarding them) to me when they give me their markups. Because of these explanations, I feel like I at least know the basics of how everything works.  Earlier this week, we received the official go-ahead to start on this project, but due to disorganization in our department & everyone in the department being totally slammed with other projects, that go-ahead fell on deaf ears. I decided to kind-of use this as an opportunity to try to get out of my comfort zone a bit.  I send an email to the engineers in the department asking if I could take a stab at taking this project as my own & designing the whole thing. Of course, before I sent this email, I went ahead and did all of the preliminary design work (including the electrical distribution) on my own & without permission (figuring that its always better to beg forgiveness than ask permission).  The head honcho engineer came over shortly after I sent the email to discuss the email I sent. He was a bit skeptical, but overall fine with the idea, particularly after I mentioned that a majority of the project is quite similar to a few others & that I was the one who did the field survey. After he gave his blessing, I showed him what I had already come up with for the design. He sat down with me for a few hours and we went through what I had already come up with (particularly the electrical distribution).  During the discussion, I mentioned that I took some pretty big guesses on sizing based on what looked right from other projects. He went through the design with me & showed me the actual math associated with designing something like this. Surprisingly, my guesses turned out to be correct & he actually mentioned that the design looked like something that he would have come up with.  I know it sounds kind-of dumb, but I really feel like I accomplished something & I've never felt so excited about work before. Hell, the owner of the company actually came over to my desk today & said that he was proud of me (I have no idea how word of my stunt got around so quickly).  I mean, I know that its still super early in the game & I have plenty of opportunities to totally crash & burn on this project, but right now, I feel on top of the world. :)",0,set2

Star garnets have inclusions that create a four- or six-pointed star when bright light shines on them, and to this day he still wistfully brings it up on occasion.  Star garnets aren't particularly expensive (although if I got a fancy metal for the setting that would be...); one big thing that's stopped me in the past from getting him a replacement is that I've never seen him wear jewelry beyond a watch and wedding ring. I have no idea what sort of style he'd like, or even what sort of male gemstone ring is good looking and not silly gangsta. I can't just ask him out of the blue what a ring he had 30 years ago looked like without it being suspicious, and he's a smart man.  So here's what I'm getting at: If you're a man or if you're in touch with men's fashion, could you look at some examples [like this](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1315&bih=813&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=5m7NWtXQE9eSjwS1l5boAQ&q=mens+ring+cabochon&oq=mens+ring+cabochon&gs_l=psy-ab.3...2119.2372.0.2475.4.4.0.0.0.0.134.249.0j2.2.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..4.0.0....0.NRuZfn8xWxU) and tell me what sort of gemstone ring setting *you* like the look of personally?

(keep in mind the train was still pretty far back so i kept asking myself if i should go through with it.) as the train got closer, i stood in the middle of the tracks and faced the train. i closed my eyes and whispered to myself 'this is it. i'm finally going to die'. the train horn was blaring constantly and i don't know if it was because he saw me standing there, or if he was just blowing the horn as the train neared the crossing. as it got even closer, the horn was blaring more constantly. at this point, i figured he saw me. the train was i would estimate about 10 seconds away from hitting me when i stepped off the tracks. i don't know why i did but something came over me at last second. the speed of the train actually knocked me down as it passed. my left hand ended up getting cut by a rusty nail that was in the road. it took about 4 minutes for the train to fully pass and i was just sitting on the ground crying the whole time. i kept hitting myself. after about 2 minutes, i got up and started walking home. i kept repeating the same question over and over again in my head. 'why didn't i go through with it? what is wrong with me?' my dog greeted me when i walked in the door but i just nudged him away and went upstairs. (i never ignore my dog like that). now, i'm laying in bed, writing about how terrible my life is even though i know nobody will care.   i'm gonna be completely honest, i know i'm going to kill myself someday. the question isn't how I'm going to do it, the question is when. tell me, is there a reason to keep going even if everybody around you wants you dead?   disclaimer: i have seem multiple therapists and such and none of them have helped. so i really don't know what to do anymore.  any tips would help i guess. if i don't reply, i think you know what that means.

We just planned a day trip including getting Mexican food and going to a museum for this weekend. She wanted to do something over spring break but we're both pretty busy with left over school work and our jobs so we had to wait until the last day to do something. It should be fun though. She told me a week or so ago that she hasn't really done much in Manhattan despite the fact that we both go to school in the city so that's how this all started. When I asked her what she wanted to do, she had no idea so I listed out a bunch of options and she chose museum.

Legit no one wanted to talk for longer than 3 minutes.  So I made a cry for help post on stop drinking. As an alcoholic I figured they would resonate with my cause. But it got removed due to the fact that I had admitted to drinking tonight. A fucking joke if you ask me.  So here I am. Contemplating suicide. I've tried the help lines and I've tried reddit.

105,"Settling other planets Ok so let's assume we're the only intelligent beings in the universe (even though that's statistically improbable). If we settle on other planets the people living there will evolve to suite the needs of that planet. Maybe theyll have senser bones such as people living on Mars so they can walk naturally on the surface and some will have incredibly thick skins and strong muscles to withstand the pressures of Venus. My point is that even if we are the only ones now, through evolution the human race will evolve into a hundred different species within the next billion years. So in theory we will have created a new form of aliens.   Of course the faster version of this would be terraforming, and even then the planets may not be perfect meaning that the people of one planet will be different the the people's of the other. It's at this point we have to ask if we are all human or are we different species all together? Will there be new forms of discrimination?

History of all sorts of crazy stuff, parents love me but in their own way. I can't remember the last time anybody in my family asked me anything about my day or what's been going on. Nobody knew my major for almost two years. I asked my dad once and he couldn't even answer me.  Sometimes I'll talk to my dad but when I was a kid he has always used me as his therapist, and after I put my foot down a few years ago we barely talk at all. I barely talk to the rest of my family and I've told them how tough its been lately. Still nobody talks to me or answers my calls even though they are on their phones all day. My extended family hang out a lot but my mom is the black sheep so we don't get invited anywhere unless it's the holidays and then my mom will often just cause some underhanded drama. I'm 30 and only just now in school, i don't even have my associates degree. I think I might have a learning disability, I've always been really inquisitive and I know a lot but as far as putting it into school work I'm often frustrated and don't get things finished. I plan things out but don't always follow through. It will take me hours to study snd when I'm done I just kinda go ""I didn't even get anything done what happened""  Moved around a lot when I was a kid. A new school every year until 10th grade. No matter where I've gone I haven't made long term friends or any friends at all. I've always been bullied. I have high self confidence but low self worth and self esteem. Sometimes I think I am prettier than I maybe am. The friends I have made are great, but will say things like ""I've stuck up for you a lot,"" without telling me what I'm doing. Sometimes I think I'm just totally unaware of what I'm doing. Some people automatically dislike me especially some other women. Guys I do date are generally great but I run them off.  I think I've been suicidal since I was 10-12. Attempted three times as a teenager and kinda rode the ""I'm still here so there has to be a reason"" thing. Lately though it hasn't been working.  I'm easily frustrated with myself. I complain a lot, like way too much. I was super duper entitled though my 20s. Now I've calmed down but I have no idea how to act most of the time.  I have a therapy appointment on Thursday. I'm hoping to get some sort of coping techniques. Maybe advice. My last two therapists were awful. I'm medicated but I'm just totally stressed out and I don't know if it will end soon or not.  Sometimes I just don't even know. I'm trying to hold out bc my grandma but I barely see her since I work so often. I work 5 days a week and take 12 credits and live alone and my plants are all dying, I don't know why.

150,"The cycle feels never ending I‚Äôm not sure where else to go so I‚Äôm going to give this a try. I‚Äôve dealt with depression for as long as I can remember, it‚Äôs put me in the hospital/psych unit once already before about 2 years ago and since then I‚Äôve held just about everything in and been able to compose myself on the outside. Inside my head has become an absolute hell. The last 3 weeks I‚Äôve been in the worst depression of my life, which climaxed 2 days ago with me trying to drink myself to death and start cutting. I have never cut before but my friends found me alone after a night of drinking with all of them, and I went into a complete manic state. Telling them to take me to the hospital and saying how if they didn‚Äôt now I was going to end it all eventually, there was no stopping it. The next day when i woke I begged them not to take me anywhere or tell my parents, partly because i wanted to sober up and because I simply could not put them through that again. I‚Äôve got cuts on my wrist and have a doctors appointment tomorrow because I‚Äôm trying to switch up meds. I‚Äôm considering cancelling because I‚Äôm scared of what she will say if she sees these cuts. I feel like I can get through it for a while if I stay sober, but obviously can‚Äôt make any promises at this point because I don‚Äôt have any real motivation for living. I‚Äôve never made an attempt sober but I‚Äôm still scared of myself at times. I just really need advice on what to do, there is counseling available at the college I attend but I‚Äôm super anxious about going to anybody right now and then finding out about the cutting. Other than that my friends are pretty mortified by what they saw, and are going to be checking to make sure I make some type of move tomorrow in the right direction.

153,"It's a hell of a lot easier to laugh than it is to cry. I was sitting in my grandfather's dining room a few weeks ago and above his table, he has a big painting. It's a really beautiful painting and my grandfather usually has pretty great stories so I asked him about it. He said that it was kind of a funny story;   When he was in college his grandmother lived nearby so he would sometime go visit her, one of her favorite things to do was to go to an auction house nearby. One weekend he and his grandmother went to the auction house together to watch the auction, they had a general rule just to watch and not to buy anything. They were walking around, just looking around at the things for sale when my grandfather saw this painting. He asked the auctioneer how much a painting like that might go for, the auctioneer said that it really depended on who was buying that day. So my grandfather and his mother moved on to look at the other items.   A little later as the auction was going on the painting came up for sale, people were bidding on the painting like crazy so my grandfather jokingly raised his paddle, Sure enough, he won the auction, the painting was his for $500. Except, he didn't have $500, so his grandmother (who was quite wealthy) decided to buy it for him. He also didn't have the space for this painting, so he sent it home to his mom's house.   When my grandfather got home for summer break his siblings got wind of the $500 painting his grandmother got for him, they were not pleased. So his grandmother decided to write all his siblings a check for $500 and his mom decided that she would like to keep the painting. In the end, my grandfather, a broke college student, ended up with a painting that stayed in his mom's house until she died and his siblings ended up with a $500 check.   It's kinda a funny story now, but I can imagine it was not so funny at the moment. My grandfather finished the story by saying ""It is what it is, and it's a whole hell of a lot easier to laugh than it is to cry.""  This is some of the best advice I've ever received and it made me wonder, what kind of stories did your grandparents tell you? What's the best piece of advice you've ever received?

I've had many lowpoints in my life including a point when I was 17 where I plunged a hair-dryer into a filled bathtub with me inside of it and it didn't electrocute me, I'm pretty sure it had something to do with the outlet I used inside the bathroom. I trusted my mother with my thoughts when I was young and she talked about it behind my back when she was with my father, discrediting it to me making excuses for my grades. I couldn't trust anyone anymore with my thoughts until I had flunked out of my number one school by isolating myself in my room for 2 months, ifinally told my parents the day before I planned to commit it, they helped me find a therapist and a psychatrist. Nevertheless I was hospitalized a month later for self harm, my parents were not sure I was safe and they work during the day, it was a particular bad day. Coming out of the hospital i felt a renewed sense of hope, I was feeling good, and ready to work on myself. Sinve then I have had tge most intense and vivid thoughts of killing myself and self harming. I've given in a few times and have cut up my face and hands, othertimes I talk to the many friends I have that are going through some of the same things. Lately I've been isolating myself from my friends and my parents have become frustrated with my lack of progress, I don't know what to do, I feel like its going to be any day now until I give into these thoughts that I have.I just don't know what to do, therapy is slightly working, but im not sure that it will be enough.

201,"I obsessively segment, reverse and visualize words in my head. I also count the amount of letters in the words. I am constantly taking words I hear or see throughout the day and breaking them into pieces in my head.  For instance, the word ""hospital"" would become hos-pi-tal to keep an even amount of letters on each side of a pivotal couple of letters in the middle.  It could also become hosp-ital but that's less satisfying.  If it's a word with an odd number of letters I'll only put one letter in the middle, such as chev-r-olet.    Not as commonly, I'll reverse words and pronounce them backwards, also in my head.  I also count the letters in the words I'm visualizing.  So if someone were to ask me how many letters are in the word ""conversation"", I would be able to instantly answer 12 without having to think, because I've ran most of the common words through my head dozens if not hundreds of times.  I also take the first letter or two of two words and swap them, so saying ""I'm going to take a shower"" turns into ""I'm going to shake a tower.""    I'm a fully functioning adult with a great career so this doesn't impact me financially in any way, but it does on occasion cause me to ""get lost"" in the word manipulation and I stop listening to people.  Normally I can do all of this and still listen, but some of the tougher, longer words cause me to really get quite in-depth.  I'm not aggressively seeking answers to what this is, I've always just attributed it to me being weird, but if someone has insight as to what it might be, I'd love to discuss it.

He isn't a bad person but his good intentions have caused a lot of pain and heartbreak between me, my mother, and my sister. I guess I could call him a toxic person. Very emotionally abusive, but not physically.   When I was 13 my parents split (more like, my mom came to her senses, grabbed my sister and me, and ran away). A restraining order was placed. Again, he never hit us, but it was more of a precaution considering his mental instability.  A few months ago I turned 18, meaning the restraining order no longer applied to me. I knew he would try to find me but I also knew that whenever that inevitably happened, I wouldn't know how to handle it.   The other day I opened my campus mailbox to find two letters from him. One of them was a simple Happy Easter card. The other one had a large quantity of bills, and a check for a LOT of money made out to my university (paying off tuition has been a struggle).   I was pretty freaked out, and compulsively deposited the check  (I know I should've waited). But now that he knows I've opened it, I feel the need to say something back to him. He literally knows where I live so I can't ignore him forever. What sort of thing should I say? He put his number in the card but I don't think I'm ready to just call or text him whenever yet. I feel like writing him a letter back?? I'm usually good at handling myself but when it comes to anything involving my old man I can't really function. So sorry if I sound a little ramble-y.

When I was in college, I interned as a program assistant at a campus organization, had one leadership role in a student group, and had a research position with a mentor. That‚Äôs basically what‚Äôs on my resume and I feel underprepared compared to a lot of other new grads, especially since my positions were in relaxing, chill, and very forgiving environments. I regularly talked and texted with my boss about stuff unrelated to work. I didn‚Äôt have a set schedule because it was a student job so I made my own and it was never full time, probably 20 hours a week.  Anyway, I‚Äôm getting called back for interviews from those 50-65k jobs. That‚Äôs a lot of money to me, especially for an entry level admin position. I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôre going to expect a lot out of me and based on my work history, I‚Äôm underprepared.

We have one classic rock station that plays the same songs every day, an ""alternative"" station that does the same thing, and several pop stations that play the same songs every hour. I'm sure there are some others but all I know is I don't get to hear music I'm really a fan of on the radio. I currently have a few different songs stuck in my head that I heard on repeat today from the radio.  When I go to workout or chill at my head coach's office at the fitness center in my college, one of the pop stations is always playing. If I'm at the gym for longer than an hour I realize that I'll hear the same songs get played that were on earlier. I try to tune them out but it's playing so loudly that I can't always do that.   One thing that bothered me a year ago when I was working out was this: I did upperbody workouts around the same time every Thursday morning. Somehow, whether I got there earlier or later than usual or changed up my order of machines I used, it seemed that every week as soon as I got on the chest press machine Chained To The Rhythm by Katy Perry started playing. I don't like Katy Perry's music. In the entire semester I think only once this did not happen and I so so appreciated Justin Timberlake for bringing Sexy Back so I could go a workout without the Katy Perry song. I could workout with my own music, but I just see that as too much of a hassle, even with wireless headphones. I don't need music to motivate me either when working out.  I know a lot of people enjoy Spotify or Pandora, but I don't use them because I know the musicians I like would lose out on money from those radio apps. The sound engineer at my theater said one of his buddies had over 100,000 plays on a song on Spotify and didn't even get $2 from that. I much rather buy a CD (either physical or digital, but preferably physical) and upload it onto my iTunes playlist to put on my iPod.   When I first got my old iPod touch I had a metal radio station I downloaded that I enjoyed but I eventually deleted it. I did find a bunch of new bands (to me) through that app though.   I hope whenever I get a car it is recent enough that it'll have an aux cord for my iPod, but old enough that it has an actual CD player since I own a good amount of physical CDs.

348,"Waiting for admission decision just to find out about incomplete application About six months ago, I completed a few applications to PhD programs I was interested in. My job environment was toxic, so I decided to quit and move home, just waiting to hear back from these schools. In the meantime, I‚Äôve been working a part time job and put my life on hold.   I was admitted to my back up school in December, but almost immediately eliminated it from contention; I was really waiting to hear from my first choice. It is a prestigious program with only a 3% admissions rate, but I was hopeful.  The website said that I would hear back by 3/31 at the latest, so I followed up today after not receiving any information. When I spoke to the admissions counselor, they told me that one of my reference letters was never received. My application was not even viewed, let alone considered. At this point, the program has filled all of their spots and there is absolutely nothing I can do except reapply next year.  I realize, as an adult, it‚Äôs my responsibility to follow-up and verify, but I still feel robbed. I never saw an indicator that my application was not complete and it was labeled as ‚Äúsubmitted‚Äù. I would‚Äôve much rather been rejected based on merit than this situation.   Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? How did you cope? ",0,set2

353,"I just wrapped up a project exploring the power of human conversation through photography There is such an intimacy in the photographer/subject relationship that few other interactions can mirror. When a subject sits for a shoot, they thrust themselves and their vulnerabilities under the spotlight. Baring all for the lens. Opening up to whatever it may capture, good or bad. Trusting the photographer's perspective. Being sincere and genuine in their expressions.¬†    For the photographer, there is a reciprocal attempt to be honest with their subject. To try to capture them as they are. ¬†To try to view the subject as they view themselves. ¬†For the duration of a photographer's shoot, the world stands still. Nothing else matters but the subject in that moment. ¬†Every ounce and atom of the photographer's undivided attention is directed towards their subject. They listen to their subject so intently with their lens that they sometimes catch fleeting glimpses of their soul.¬†   What if this was how we conversed? What if we talked like we photographed?    I have been obsessed with this notion of conversation for the last few months.¬† Obsessed with how to approach conversation for a specific purpose, the benefits of conversation, the different forms it takes.    This photography project began with the intention of ""capturing the essence"" of various participants but it's since morphed into something¬†more.¬†   We typically began with coffee/tea, where introductions are made and the project is explained.¬† After 10-15 minutes of casual conversation, we move the conversation to the photography studio, where I shift ownership of the conversation to the participant.¬† ""Talk about¬†whatever¬†you want"", I usually tell them. And the exchange that followed has been one of the most powerful, most humbling experiences of my life to date:    In that dim and private studio I have listened to grief. I have listened to pain and suffering and frustration. I have heard ambition and I have heard passion. I have heard happiness and excitement and hope.¬† The hills and valleys of everyday life. I've met heartbreak and then watched blossoming love chase it away.¬†    There is something so so powerful about an open ear. About someone just willing to listen without judgement. Someone willing to block everything out and completely focus on¬†your¬†life experience for a few moments.   Often times, the participant would open up immediately, with very little effort, as if they had been waiting for the opportunity to share. Other times, participants were a little more hesitant and had their guards up.¬† The balancing act was trying engage in that beautiful interaction without imposing.¬†¬†  Many times, the room was on the verge of tears.¬† Many times the room was filled with laughter, echoing out into the halls.¬† Many times the sessions concluded with hugs and handshakes and the forging of friendships.¬† Many times the participants would express gratitude for the conversation, knowing little of how humbled¬†I¬†was for being allowed that privilege and how therapeutic it was for¬†me.¬†    I like to think it helped that the participants and I made a conscious effort to approach the conversation¬†at equal level, instead of some sort of¬†saved-savior dynamic.¬† I was not qualified to provide any sort of solution or feedback to things they discussed, nor did I want to, nor were they necessarily looking for that.¬† I simply wanted to¬†listen¬†and to be¬†present¬†in that moment. And they simply wanted to talk.¬†¬†    And so I'd like to continue.¬† I believe we can soothe the suffering, the frustration, the anger, the pain, the sadness that consumes our world today, one person at a time.¬† One conversation at a time, one photo at a time.¬†¬†    If you or someone you know is interested, get in touch with me through the¬†Contact¬†page and I would be honored to¬†lens you my ear.¬†",0,set2

357,"Smartphones (#86) I have mentioned it a few times before, but I'll repeat here--I have a flip phone. I've had it since Oct. 17, 2009 and it has worked well for the past 8+ years. It's called the Alias 2 and [here is what it looks like.](https://imgur.com/a/IAffN) People are usually impressed by the fact that the buttons change depending on how it is flipped. Other than that though, my friends have given me shit for this phone for since probably 2011.   As smartphones became more and more prevalent to the point where it's rare to know anybody who doesn't have one, my phone has become more obsolete. My friends have given my phone many nicknames, include ""the brick"" or ""the toaster.""  I'm able to call, text, and take surprisingly decent quality photos ([example here](https://imgur.com/nbXAO2e)) and that's I really have needed for so long. Sure I can't get group texts or emojis (and honestly, since the IOS 11 update getting texts from iPhones in general sucks) but for the most part I have no issues. If I need to be connected to something I'll use my laptop or my iPod.  However, I'm very aware that my time for owning this phone is coming to an end. Even though the battery life is still fine, the phone has been giving in some ways. I can no longer text when I am at a subway station underground. Sometimes the phone will randomly shut itself off even with a full charge. And for a future full time job (especially since as a dog trainer I'll have to be in contact with clients and stuff) I know I'll need to get a smartphone to do that. Hell, I was looking at job postings recently a couple listed owning a smartphone as a requirement. I also should have access to Uber/Lyft as well and other important things like that which make life easier.  I just don't want a smartphone. I hate how big they are. I hate how confusing they are. I hate how connected to the world I can become no matter where I am. I see it in myself already with just my iPod and laptop if I have wifi, I am constantly on reddit/social media. I don't want to get sucked in even more with no restrictions.   I begrudgingly told my mom that I guess my graduation present should probably be a smartphone even though I don't want one. She knows I wish I could have my flip phone forever but as someone in their early 20s in this time in history, it's nearly impossible to do much without one. She asked which I would want to get, a galaxy like her and my dad, or an iPhone like my brother. And I honestly don't know. While I hate Apple as a company cause they are cheap and don't seem to give a fuck about their consumers, iPhones are so much easier to use. At least in my experience.   So I turn it to all of you to debate what type of smartphone I should get (with actual objective facts).  ^^^^^^^^^^.  ^^^^Trying ^^^^to ^^^^not ^^^^use ^^^^the ^^^^same ^^^^exact ^^^^questions ^^^^I ^^^^used ^^^^in ^^^^my ^^^^22nd ^^^^post ^^^^because ^^^^that ^^^^was ^^^^on ^^^^a ^^^^very ^^^^similar ^^^^topic  In what ways has owning a smartphone benefited you?

359,"My opinions on the Pinocchio Paradox. Hallo. There was this idea I thought of a long time ago that I wanted people's opinion on. It was nothing too big, I just wanted a nice little discussion. However, I put that on rest since I didn't know where exactly I should talk about that. Recently, I came into notice of r/CasualConversation which I found to be a neat little place to talk about random stuff. I thought it would be great to be finally able to share and discuss about this idea. So without further ado, here it is.  If Pinocchio says, ""My nose will now grow."" he would be lying and this will cause the nose of his to grow. However, since his nose grew, he would not be lying and his nose should not grow.   I believe that the answer to this solution is, his nose will grow if Pinnochio says the special statement. This is because the nose only grows if Pinnochio himself is the one who is lying and note that the statement is said before the nose started to grow. His nose only corresponds if he is lying or not; it does not count the actions of itself either. If we count in these two factors, I believe we will have a solid reasoning that the answer to this paradox, will be that his nose will grow.  So er well, what do you think?",0,set2

361,"I've finally ditched my iPhone for a Samsung. First of all, I don't want to start an argument here. Each has its own pros and cons, it all comes down to the person whose using it.   I'm normally an Android guy, but switched to an iPhone 6S Plus, 28 months ago, because at the time there weren't any good Android phones in the market (at the time. The phones were either known for overheating (thanks to Snapdragon 808/810), sucky battery life (once again, thanks to the 808/810, and Samsung for putting small batteries on their phones), and has defects (bootlooping, easily bends, etc).   I just wanted a phone without any defects, has good camera, has LTE bands I need for Asia and North America, and something that would last me all day. The iPhone 6S Plus fitted the bill. It served my needs for the last 28 months.  However, I wanted a dual-sim phone, so I would no longer carry two phones, due to greedy carriers here. Besides that, mainly I also miss Android's versatility. You rarely need a computer (to transfer stuff). Also, I switched to an iPhone because they have Apple stores and authorized service center throughout the whole world, so I can have my phone repaired in the same day. But then I realized that we don't have any Apple stores in the country (the Philippines), and there's one service center nearby, and they won't service a phone that wasn't bought locally. Whereas with Samsung, they have a brick and mortar stores, and service centers here.   I decided to trade my iPhone 6S Plus for a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro. A used 6S Plus and a like-new Galaxy J7 pro worth about the same. The camera on the J7 is just as good, also has the LTE bands my iPhone offers, and it has a bigger battery. With those, I don't really miss my 6S Plus. I wanted an S9 Plus, but I can't afford it.  It feels like the weight has been lifted off my shoulder. I no longer need to carry two phones, and I now have versatility of Android, back. Besides, I now have a bigger battery. Which means, even with heavy usage, I won't have to charge the darn thing for two days. I still have an iPad, so I won't miss iOS either  Anyone switched from one platform to another recently?

As a kid, I was very outgoing, but around 12 I started to change, I spent most of my time with myself. It's hard to explain why. Now looking back I wish I'd have spent more time with teens of my age, but I didn't. There is a 10 years period of social activity pause and that's a fact.    Now I don't know for sure, but I guess I'm beating myself up for nothing. It's like sure, people say socialization is one of the keys to happiness, but it seems like a ""grass is greener"" on the other side scenario. Are the people who had a big social circle as teens happier in their 20s than those people who didn't have a big social circle ?     I don't know, I wish to discuss this. ",0,set2

412,"Need help.I don't want to kill myself. PLEASE BEAR WITH ME.  So,I'm 21,been facing really hard times since childhood from being bulllied to messed up home enviornment to resigning from my first job within 5 months last year because of same type of toxic people at work.I was still doing okay.But 2 days back we had some glass door repair work at home and called a man who takes work for installing glass door.To give an idea, where I'm from only rowdy people or corrupt politicians could survive,either you yourself have to be a badass asshole type criminal or should know someone who is involved in those type of acti ities ,especially a politician,otherwise there is no justice for a simple/common/mango man. Coming back to that day when the incidemt took place,I'll have to go back to 2 more days back from that day.Before calling in this man, let's call him(Y),we had called someone else to perform the job,let's call him(X).But (X) did not make the glass door as per our expectation and was not responding to our calls afterwards,so I went to his workshop and took back the advance money deposited with him.Now we call (Y),someone who we contacted through another shop nearby our locality.He comes in, took the advance money ,took the reference picture with him, which I had clicked of the glass door which got shaterred which is why we are getting a new one installed.He promised to install it by the next day.Next day he sends his people who were to install it but to our surprise the glass door was exactly the one which was made by(X) and which we had rejected.Upon inquiring with the people who brought it with them,we got to know that it was indeed from the same workshop i.e. (X)'s because they get their work done from X's workshop. After this my mother called that person(Y),to inform about this because it did not match the reference picture we had given him and how he  could send this glass door without even checking it and he started giving round answers and told my mother he will come within half an hour to our place to look at the problem.He then called his people on the phone who were infront of us and called them back and instructed them to leave the glass there itself i.e. our home.After this when again my mother called him to know when he was coming as it was already late ,his tone of talking had already changed and stared saying something rude and started lying,upon which I took the phone and asked him strictly whether he was coming or not and what he would do in this regard,to which he told me he will get a new one installed as per our reference photo.After this he sent his worker to our place to take the other glass door with him for proper size reference and design(mind that glass size is not too big),and we indeed gave it to him in a hope for the satisfactory result.Next day his workers came with the new glass along with the old one they took along with them.But we were shocked when we noticed there was a crack in the old glass which they took for the reference purpose.We immediately called (Y) and he arrived few minutes later and asked his people(workers) whether it was during the time  they were installing the glass cracked to which they replied no.Right after this he started shouting loudly that he isn't going to pay for it,and started behaving really ill mannered way and became aggressive while walking towards my mother,to which I came forward and started shouting on him as well and that went  for several minutes and I don't remember much of what he said bevause I literally was not into my senses,meanwhile my mother kept telling me to calm down and not to stoop to his way of cheap talking.Even then my mother did not raisd her voice and talked to him with patience telling him not to raise his voice as this is someone's home not road.After that I told him to finish that work off and leave that old glass and leave the place.I paid his full amount cause that way he got to know his real value because it was not at all about money,we were really calm while talking and would have had even paid for the glass that cracked due to their mistake.   What really hurt me and kicked my nervousness,anxiety and fear is,after all these years of coping with the bullying I had at school,someone dared to shout and get aggressive in my own home where I thought I was safe.I feel guilty for not being able to protect my mother's dignity and respect because of the way he talked.What if he would have had caused her any harm ,what I would have had done then.I feel powerless,feared and isolated today.The person(Y),had mentioned about working at a property dealer's place nearby our house who has two wives and is involved politically.These are the kind of people due to whom these (Y) type of shameless creatures do crimes in the broad day light.  Now again I have gotten into depression and extreme fear that if in future he becomes powerful(Y) and tries to harm my family in any way,what I will do then because I cannot be sitting at home forever.My mother has suffered for very long in family for different reasons.After he went away I could see her sad although she did say while smiling that don't mind these type of incidents or people and not to get upset about it.But I fear for my mother,family, even myself.Also this incident has literally shaterred my self esteem and confidence that someone really dared to behave that way in my home,took out his frustration and I could not stop him from doing that.Why is these type of things happening with me ,I am lost.What should I do.I don't want to live in fear all my life.There is no rule and law .I don't want to go down the path of becoming a criminal,because I feel that is the only way dealing with these type of people.

Everything dies or becomes something else, so, might as well enjoy what you are when you're it. While alive, I have things I have accomplished and things I probably never will. Some personal achievements and wild aspirations of mine include:  -Wasted more money I will ever make on ""higher education"" only to learn that I learned no skills and was primed for nothing in the real world. If someone is thinking about going to college/university for the arts, try first without wasting the money.  -Got married though I was convinced I would never do something so contractually obligating in my life. Turns out, love is real and also really lovely. WARNING: change is a requirement. Love is fraught with adaptability, in the most delightful ways.  -I've always wanted to be famous. Not rich, just known. Not known for something, just acknowledged. I know I will die without achieving fame or anything close to it. I have come to terms with the fact that it would require me being someone I am not. Still- I could make a lot of people smile like some celebrities do.  -Worldbuilding and the challenges of creating something from nothing with an imaginative yet chaotic brain. Most people who create things on Earth are highly creative people or highly intelligent, or both. I am neither intelligent nor creative but instead am uncontrollably imaginative. With that came Topia, a board game concept I am creating where the game plays itself and can even be played solo. The Topian universe lacks Earth's ultimate guarantee of death and even lacks humans. It's a great place for me to play and know there is no one else involved in it.

I currently have my permit, but learning to drive is really low on my priority list. I'm lucky enough to have a supportive family and they aren't pressuring me at all. However, I feel like a burden because they always drive me to where I need to go. (This is solely my own feeling, my family has told me multiple times that it's okay.) Also, I don't feel independent in that aspect, obviously, so there are days where it takes a toll on my self-esteem. Like, I should be driving and taking responsibility for myself  since I'm an adult. Everyone around me--classmates, friends, co-workers, extended family etc-- knows how to drive and tend to ask me why I haven't learned yet. If I'm not in a good mindset, it tends to rub me the wrong way and I end up feeling insecure.   Have any of you experienced the same feeling? If so, how did you come to accept it? I don't want to rush into driving and end up in a bad situation. Plus, it's really not something I feel like putting time and energy into right now. How do I become more patient and not let the opinions of others affect what I want to do?   ",0,set2

It was so surreal and the only way for me to escape this world. Whenever my parents take away my laptop I feel like someone just took a part from me. When my parents had fights about divorce late at night like 3am I would wake up while crying then pull out my laptop and start playing minecraft, or watching youtube while tears rolled down my cheeks. I always dreamed of becoming a youtuber so I can feel my opinion was heard by others cause I always felt worthless. When my dad took my laptop away from me I would pretend that I was filming a video talking about my struggles and how to overcome it while strolling around my room. I never really felt genuine love from anybody, ever, and the internet was the only place that made me feel loved. I truly don't know if I can handle this world without the internet, it just makes me very numb but happy at the same time. I would truly smile when watching videos, but not when I spend time with friends and family. This is how much it mattered to me, and how it really reflected me as a person. I don't know how to cure it, nor do I know how to just take a break from. Last time I forced myself to give it up for 4 months of summer 2017 I broke into tears everyday.

I'm asking because I'm writing a pop song with this theme, and I want the chorus to be a variation on this similie. I normally just write everything myself, but I'm having trouble getting this song's lyrics finalized.

I'm arguing with myself essentially. I'm simultaneously aware of how irrational I'm being, but I still can't help myself.  The right metaphor will become the chorus/song title and can really make or break the song. If I use your idea I'll give you a writing credit if you want one (bookmark me, this account ain't going anywhere).  Right now the song has a futuristic feel. There's a talkbox in the chorus, and some funk guitar. There's also some wah-wah synths. Lots of harmonies and layers to the vocals. It's just really funky and dancey.

483,"Recently adopted the minimal texting lifestyle, now concerned I'm seen as indifferent I used to text/Gchat with my two friends everyday. Would text my nieces at least every few days and when online dating I'd try to keep a consistent texting cadence. Then in all honesty a guy I was into didn't text back the same and that would drive me nuts. After a few weeks I realized that my texting lifestyle and expectations weren't healthy. So I changed and only text to make meet in person. Only kept the same with my nieces bc they are family and want to be involved in their lives. It was hard to change and now I find it odd to text a few times a day.    However, I started to online date again. The individuals I hit it off don't text often with me and I only really text to set up next date. I am now wondering if it might come off as not being interested in them.

489,"Thank you, random girl from the store. You made my day! I live in a small town in Turkey. So today I went to a store nearby to buy some stuff, coke and milk and cookies and coated peanuts and things like that. When I got to the check out there were like six people queued, which is pretty impressive for such a small store. The cashier was a pretty and hard-working young woman, and she was doing her best to get all the items quickly so that people don't have to wait for long. Apparently she was working alone at that time.  I was the last customer in the line, but a young guy before me said, ""You go first, sir, I gotta get some other stuff."" I went before him and the girl immediately said her usual ""Welcome to our store!"" and started checking my stuff out. She enthusiastically asked whether I was interested in buying any of the things that were on sale today, with samples stacked right next to her, and I gladly picked some pudding. She said ""Thank you!"" and I replied ""Thank *you*"" with a smile.   And then she said something right out of the blue. ""Haven't seen you in a few days. Is it that you hadn't come here, or is it that I wasn't here when you did come?"" I was stumped. I didn't know what to say, so I just said, ""Really? I was here yesterday..."" (which I can't really remember.) And she replied, ""Yes I know you came here yesterday, but I mean before that, you know I haven't seen you in like four or five days.""  This is when my Turkish failed me and I just mumbled, ""Um.. I don't know really"" with a stupid smile, and then pretended to be busy bagging my stuff. She helped me bag them and before I left, I gave her a big, immensely grateful smile and said, ""Thank you very much"" and went home.  And now here I am telling you about it, because it really mattered to me. It mattered because someone who just randomly happens to work in a store nearby, actually missed me, noticed my absence. It mattered because she felt safe enough to ask me where I've been without worrying that I might respond in a rude or dismissive manner. It mattered because I genuinely believed that no one cared, and she, simply and elegantly and with just a simple exchange, proved me flatly wrong.  Thank you, random girl from the store.

I'm mainly thinking back to 2005-2007ish times when the internet was becoming more of the 'thing' it exists as today, and idk man. It just seemed like there were so many different subcommunities and online groups/sites with their own flair, culture, inside jokes, and overall so much bright silliness and creativity (not that there wasn't lots of bad things, trolls, etc. etc.). Now it feels like there's just some 'big' websites that feel more or less the same, and maybe really small interest-specific blogs or pages on top of those.   For me being on the internet (recreationally) used to feel so much more exciting, like you were always discovering new sites or communities or memes or whatever. And more than that it was almost secretive(?), or I guess people never talked about much internet going-ons or memes irl. Now, with phones and social media like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit tbh the 'real' and 'online' worlds have more or less merged, or at least finding the divide is much more difficult.    IDK, like I said, this is all pretty much me just being nostalgic over my childhood and making 2006 internet sound much more special and amazing than it actually was.

514,"I got a job! I'm super excited and don't have anyone to share in it with, so Reddit you're gonna get my stream of consciousness.  I've trying for months to get a better job, and after a week of interviews I finally got an offer making nearly twice my current salary!  For the past 18 months I've been working as the General Manager and sole bread baker (crusty sourdough, the kind of old world bread takes 3 days to make) in a small but busy cafe/panini restaurant. It is severely understaffed, to the point where often times during the morning commute rush I am the only employee and have to take orders, brew coffees, make espresso drinks (decades old Italian machine, not a single automated aspect), make and run sandwiches/salads, prep the food, and mix/shape/bake bread. Then also squeeze in inventory/ordering, scheduling, cash management/reports, dishes (entirely hand washed, no machine), janitorial work, etc. You get the idea.  When I took the job initially I had just found out my wife cheated on me and we were divorcing. It was Thanksgiving and I was in a low place. I allowed my current bosses to take advantage of me and agreed to a year long contract before I agreed to a pay. It was only supposed to be for making bread, nothing else. I was hired specifically for my French bread experience. They had previously only been making super sweet spongy type breads (and not very good quality ones IMHO, but I know I'm a snob). I was desperate, moving to a new state, and this job initially seemed like it would be less stressful.  I've never made much money. I used to work in office administration/bookkeeping, but when the 2008 market made me lose my job I decided to go to culinary school so I could at least enjoy what I did at work. I chose to work in kitchens that couldn't pay well, but either looked good on my resume or were places I could learn new techniques.   The owners told me they think my salary of $27,500 is 'more than fair'. As recently as last week they told me they expect me to work 12 hour days if need be to save on labor costs.  I started looking for a new job 6 months ago, but nothing seemed like a good fit. Most kitchens tend to run high with testosterone, and I'm not about that. Or they demand 50-60+ hour work weeks that break your back, and I'm getting too old for that. Good bread bakeries are few and far between. And it's really hard to find time to job hunt while working a full time job that is actually causing you to go further into debt.   I'm in debt up to my eyeballs. My bank account is empty. I'm divorced. I've lost contact with most all of my friends from before I was married. But right now, I couldn't be happier. I've got my two kittens and In two weeks I'll start  making more money than I ever have before. And it'll be the first place in a while I will be proud to tell people I work at.

515,"I just rocked a phone interview! (and here‚Äôs how I did it...) Am sitting alone after having just had a really good phone interview (they offered me the job on the spot) and just wanted to share both my happiness and tips on what helped me so it might help anyone else who might be in a similar situation.  I spent about 3-4 hours before the interview doing preparations.  I got 5 sheets of paper and put bold titles on the top of each: 1. About the organization and where the role fits in, 2. Duties and Accountabilities, 3. Selection Criteria, 4. Other Practical Examples, and 5. My Questions.  I then filled in information in my best handwriting on each sheet.  I used a notepad for scribbling down rough notes for each on a separate paper.  But the important thing was that I eventually wrote the good notes down by hand.  This because I read something about the learning process that things sink into your memory better when you write them by hand rather than type.  For the sheet 1. I bullet pointed everything relevant I could find in the job description / website, writing key words in red.  For sheets 2 and 3 (duties and selection criteria) I put what was listed in the job description bullet pointed down the left side of the paper (again highlighting key words) and then wrote how I fit each point with practical examples on the right side.  For sheet 4 I brainstormed other practical examples of topics that I guessed would probably come up in interview questions, like ‚Äúcommon problems‚Äù and ‚Äúinnovations‚Äù, etc.  For sheet 5 I listed the questions I had.  I had all 5 sheets laid out in front of me (along with my CV and covering letter) when the phone interview started.

The problem is, she was giggling while typing on her phone half the time. I knew what was going on. I tried not to let it show but I'm pretty sure it did, it killed me. I'm so conflicted, on one hand I want her to be happy even above my own happiness so I'm happy she's happy, but on the other it kills me that she's moved on so fast.  I've tried to go on dates. One girl made fun of my teeth and left, another I went on a couple of dates with and she was nice and it even progressed to her initiating an intimate relationship. I couldn't perform, I felt this massive amount of depression and guilt. It felt like I was cheating on my ex. I'd rather be alone than feel that again.

543,"Introducing: The New Mods of r/CasualConversation! As you may have noticed, there's a few new mods around these here parts. Please feel free to AUA (ask us anything) over the next few days, we'll be happy to answer :)  Be warned: This is going to be an ENORMOUS post (pushing 5,500 characters).  **HysteriacTheSecond**: Salut! I'm /u/HysteriacTheSecond (although perhaps that part is redundant since my username is provided anyway), or Emily for short. Feel free to call me anything, though; I really don't mind! \^_\^ Other little tidbits: I'm from a little village in the north of England, and I'm likely one of the younger moderators here at age seventeen.  I really am so excited to be a part of the community here at /r/CasualConversation. I've always seen this subreddit as a great bastion for a combination of the wholesome and friendly nature for which all subreddits should strive with the great size that makes such an achievement often nearly impossible. I, of course, know that this is partly down to the fantastic work put into the subreddit by the moderation team, and to be able to help the team with this goal is something about which I am incredibly proud.  My passions often rest within the avant-garde: I adore delving into all that is 'out-there' in the arts, from James Joyce (favourite: *Finnegan's Wake*) in literature, to David Lynch (favourite: *Inland Empire* / *Mulholland Drive* / *Twin Peaks: The Return* / [Oh gosh I have no idea](https://imgur.com/a/grlhL)) in film, to Autechre (favourite: *Chiastic Slide*) in music, to Francis Bacon (favourite: *Pope I*) in fine art. Bar the arts, I also adore philosophy; catching up with the Nintendo Switch's first year; playing Dungeons & Dragons, among other board games; staring at pictures of buns (preferably [king buns](https://xkcd.com/1682/) but I'm not fussy); and spreadsheets.  :-)  **SoapyTheBum**: Howdy! I'm SoapyTheBum, you can just call me Soapy. I live in New York, right in the suburbs of the city.  I'm so happy to be part of this community because of how much I really enjoy being here and engaging with all of the other people who are just looking to shoot the breeze. The relaxed atmosphere, the friendly mood, the encouraging responses all come together to create just a wonderful community that I'm not only glad to be part of, but also proud to be part of.  While I have a lot of hobbies, the ones that I seem to talk the most about are cooking and reading, and I'm always willing to talk about either those things, as well as any other topic that I'm either familiar with or interested in.  Other hobbies that I enjoy are: board games, dungeons and dragons, video games, and pop culture, and music.  **Lousy_Try_Brian**: Hey, everyone! My name isn't really Brian (I'm actually a woman!) so you can call me Lousy. :) I'm so excited to join the team!  I love r/CasualConversation because it embodies the best of the internet: a place where strangers from all over the world can share in pleasant conversation without the usual trolling, hostility, and other ugliness that creeps in so easily. I am so grateful to have a chance to join the mods and contribute to this awesome sub!  I'm from the great, if misunderstood, state of Utah in the USA. I'm in my 30s, so I think I may be one of the older mods. I work as a technical writer by day, and in my free time I love to bake delicious things, read interesting books, and spend time with my family. I'm looking forward to seeing you all around the sub!  **Mel_Pond**: Howdy y'all! My name is Mel, or Melody, or even River Song if you want (Yes, it's definitely a Doctor Who reference). I've always loved the strong sense of community in the sub and I'm insanely happy to give back however I can! I'm definitely the youngest of the mod team, and I'm also a fairly artistic individual. I look forward to the next few months!  **Love_The_Heat**: Hi everyone. New guy. A quick blurb about myself?  It all started when my life was flipped and turned upside down. I was born and raised in Philadelphia where I spent a lot of time at this local playground where we mostly chilled, relaxed, and shot basketball.  One day these no good guys started trouble and we got in a fight. It was crazy actually. One guy picked me up and swung me around in a circle on his shoulders. I bet it looked crazy from above. Anyways, my mom got scared and sent me to Cali to live with my Aunt and Uncle. It's about 7 or 8 right now as I write this and I can't believe that I'm finally here with ye as the new Prince of CC.  My neck hurts, but nice to meet you!  **MattsOutrageous**: Hey guys! My name is Matt. you can also call me Adam (my middle name) if you prefer :) I'm based in the UK so I guess I'll be taking the morning shift ;)  I'm so happy to be a part of r/CasualConversation because I absolutely love the community here. Everyone seems to be invested in others and supportive, caring, kind... You're all fantastic. Above all, y'all know how to have a conversation, casually.  I'm definitely not the youngest in the mod team at 24 years old, but I don't think I'm the oldest either!  I'm a huge fan of video games.

However, it still has Windows 7 which will be phased out soon (don't get me started on trying to upgrade it to 10), it loads things super slowly, and the hard drive sometimes seems to mysteriously fill up without me doing anything (I get the low disk space prompt all the time). A couple years ago I had to go through the whole process of reformatting my laptop because it crapped out and wouldn't even boot Windows.  Still, I'm the type of person that hates to buy a newer model unless the older model isn't even usable anymore. Same thing for my phone and for my car - I didn't buy a new one until I literally had to tow my car to the dealership for engine overheating (among other things). I guess the reason why I bought a new laptop now is so I could be proactive about transferring to a new computer so it won't be as much of a hassle later on (and I'm getting tired of dealing with my current one), but there's still a part of me that feels like I should still try to squeeze as much out of my current laptop as I can, lol.  Anyone else feel this way about buying new stuff? How do you justify your purchases? I do have my impulsive/frivolous buys on occasion, but I've always been pretty careful with my money, so I often subscribe to the ""if I don't need it I don't buy it"" philosophy.",0,set2

572,"Emails (#94) ^^^^I ^^^^think ^^^^this ^^^^is ^^^^the ^^^^shortest ^^^^time ^^^^between ^^^^two ^^^^posts ^^^^I've ^^^^had ^^^^so ^^^^far  Prior to the end of of the spring 2017 semester, I was always on top of all my emails. I hated seeing the little red number notification on my email icon on my laptop or my old iPod touch. As soon as I would get an email from someone, I would reply. I was always very diligent with keeping up with everything.  Then I had to start thinking about my capstone and I had to be in contact with my capstone mentor but that (still to this day when my draft is due tomorrow) felt too overwhelming so I pushed it off and started checking my emails less and less. When I got my new iPod Touch I even deleted the email app from it because I didn't want the constant reminders of my laziness. When I turned on my laptop for the first three years of college I would open the email app and the internet browser as soon as my laptop turned on. Now I haven't opened my email app in months because I'm afraid of the scolding emails saying I should be doing this or that. I still check my emails in the web browser occasionally. I just checked and I have 54 unread emails in my personal email and 29 unread in my college email. That's a lot for me. Most of them are things I consider spam that really aren't, and only one or two are things I should actually care about. When I am done stressing about my school work and being reprimanded for not doing well I do plan on getting back into my habit of checking my emails religiously like in the past.   I never understood how people could just let unread (or even read emails) pile up to the thousands. I had a friend with over 20,000 unread emails. For me, I read the emails, reply if necessary, and then delete them from my inbox if they aren't important enough to keep. Some I'll save into other folders or just keep in my inbox until after a specific date. Every now and then I'll clear out my deleted emails folder and my other folders as well when things are no longer needed in my life.   I hate getting the automatic list-server emails from companies after buying something from them or signing up for some other service on their website. I also hate getting spam after spam from organizations repeatedly when I don't even know how I got on their list to begin with. I have no idea how many email lists I've unsubscribed from over the years. At some point I was getting so much spam in my inbox it took over the emails I needed to get. The only organization I wont unsubscribe from is the company that took my high school graduation photos. They'll still email me once every couple of months asking me to buy the photos even though I graduated in 2014.  When I was around middle school, even though there was AIM, Facebook, and texting, my main way of keeping in contact with a lot of people was via email. Even my grandma! I still have a very small handful of those old emails saved and I wish I had more just so I could look back and see what stupid shit my friends and I would share with each other that seemed so important at 11 years old.   When I m working in the office I have an email relating to the theater that I keep very organized. I didn't set up this email since I wasn't the first assistant my manager has had, so there are tons of emails from before I started working in the office. When I first started there were a large amount of unread emails (over 700) and lots of useless emails in the inbox. I asked my manager if I could go through them and delete what was no longer needed. She showed me which types of emails I should keep and what weren't necessary anymore so I went through all of them until it was all nice and neat. Only a few months ago did it dawn on my to make separate folders for the old emails. Now I have a folder for all the emails before my time, and folders for each six month contract since the older emails aren't important unless the client returns to the theater. Also with this email I do not check it at all unless I am in the office and getting paid. My manager has realized this and, despite her workaholic personality, has accepted that I wont reply to anything when I am not in the office. If something is urgent she'll either text me and email my personal email. I didn't do this so much when I first started working in the office and I felt some of the stress from work carry me home but once I took a hard stance with this approach, things got better.  How many unread emails do you have?  Are there any organizations you get automatic emails from that you don't bother unsubscribing from?  Do you organize your emails in different folders or just let everything sit in your inbox?  Did you ever actually send those old chain emails out to people?

573,Back to where I was nearly a year ago About a year ago this May I posted on another account about how I wanted to die because I messed up my relationship among other things. I then sorted things out with her and everything was great which I updated on.  Now we are taking kind of a break because yet again I cannot be a good person. I always just do shit my own way without thinking of her feelings and opinions.  We have been talking all day and she says she loves me still but she is not sure if she can believe that I can be that person again. I had already promised her this but I just took her for granted.  We had an abortion a few months ago which I was always for but I did say it was her choice. We had it but she told me how much she regretted it after and I do too as I know we would be a happy family by now and would be getting married in one month.  Now all of that is gone or in doubt and I have nothing to show for my life.  I just want to end it but I am also scared to end it. I live near a large bridge that connects Wales and England so it is always an option for me but I don't know what is left for me in life if we end.  I am a bit of a loner and so is she but I don't blame her for wanting to end it. I have fucked it up so many times,1,set2

578,"Writing Feedback? So, I went to the Chicago Art museum today, and in It, I saw a sculpture of a woman who accidentally killed herself through her own stupidity on her wedding day. So, a 'tragic hero', but what if the tragedy was not an accident? It's a bit inspired this myth, some Taming of the Shrew/12 Things I hate about you, and some of Remus & Romulus (Myth of the founding of Rome)     ‚ÄúYou should do it sister, it will be fun‚Äù The sister of the bride encouraged, opening the chest at the foot of the bed. The bride gave a soft smile, and sat down in it. Her husband was downstairs, draining drinks at the reception. He loved surprises, right? She was sure, and she bent over, wrapping her arms around her upper legs. Her splitting image closed the lid of the chest, the iron hasp on the front locking it loosley. ‚ÄòFool‚Äô she thought to herself, as she draped the cover back over the chest. Then she put the heavy iron lock pin through the hasp, sealing one of their fates.  Somewhere along the line, she had been labeled as dumb. It was far from the truth. She had earned the label because she did not listen, and questioned authority. She was sharp as a razor, and cunning as a wolf. Her sister was an obedient and empty headed sheep. However, the sheep was the one who had hours earlier married the son of a rich nobleman. She was set to go to a nunnery.   ‚ÄúRemember, don‚Äôt make a sound, or the surprise will be lost‚Äù the wolf said, blowing out one of the candles, then the other, and then taking the third with her. She closed the door, and went down to the reception. At the head table was her mother, her father, the parents of the groom, and the groom. Her sister's seat was not the only one empty, but she took it.   It was actions like these that caused the negative connotations around her. Everyone knew the finances of the wedding. While they were not poor, they were not rich either. There was good money and many promises made for a hand in marriage. Just not hers.     What do you think? Any feedback is appreciated",0,set2

585,"Procrastinating even with suicide I actually planned to kill myself today. I set it up during Friday. Planning my methods. Setting up the date, saying Monday midnight is my time.

Imagining the pain it gives as I pull the knife upward, blood drenching the bedsheet, and painting my shirt.   My blood pooling beneath me.   And imagines like those were playing in my head, smiling as I envision it all. Oh how my mother who would wake me up, find me bleeding, and she would scream.   How my sister would find the note left on my desk. Telling of my plans, to not spread word of my death tonight. To only say it on my eighteen birthday, that I, have perished, using my own hands.   Within the car I would talk to my mind, preparing the note that would tell of my plan. And Saturday has came, my mind unchanged, and finally Sunday. Waiting for the night to cover the lands.   But then... something happened. As I ready my laptop, preparing the letter of my farewell. My childhood friend and best friend, she had messaged me, when we haven't talked for days. And with that sudden message, I knew someone or something within this world was watching me. They were preventing me of my plan.   Then messages of my old classmate friend telling me of how she had missed me so much. Telling a story of how certain songs had reminded her of me. And how now she offers to stay up with me till the night.  And an old friend whom I have not chatted in months, had suddenly said hi. Just really proves of something stopping me tonight.   My friends know nothing of my plan, and so they spoke none stoping me this night, but the time I spoke to them, has taken my time of writing down the things I wanna say before I go.   I can't kill myself without a note.   I find this unfair. Truly unfair. I feel nothing anymore. I just want to die and stab myself, but now my energy has left.

Before I start my story, I want to say that I'm not suicidal in any way and wish I never will be, I was recommended this Reddit page by my friend to get help and I'm hoping I'm not breaking any rules.   The story starts off by me waiting for my mother to pick me up from school (Grade 11). She stops by a Walmart before she picks me up so I'm in a grumpy mood because I'm all alone waiting for my mother to pick me up. When she arrives, I tell her what took her so long and clearly she can tell I'm not happy by her actions. But then we go to the store before we arrive home to buy some meat and all goes well. After we arrive home, I go eat some left overs outside because of the nice weather and the nature looked beautiful . At the same time, I'm waiting for my friend to arrive so I can help fix his computer. After 3-4 four hours later after fixing my friends computer, he leaves and then I begin to do my homework (8 o'clock?). Later my Father arrives home and goes to take a shower, he's clearly drunk and is drunk most of the time when he comes home. My mother than calls me to her to room and calls me selfish, a terrible person, child, and wish that I was never born. She tells me these things because I was suppose to finish plowing the field in my backyard for the garden but I told her before hand that I couldn't today. She also tells me this because I didn't tell before hand that my friend would come over (definitely my fault, should of told her beforehand). Generally though, she doesn't get mad if a friend comes over which also blew my mind. After hearing this, I just stand there with my mouth open, feeling a sense of shock from hearing my own mother not wanting me to exist.

596,"I miss flash games. I play games on my phone a lot. But ""play games"" seems to mean ""play games for a couple of days then delete them"". The only game I've really stuck with on my phone for the past several months is Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links, which kind of brings me to my problem. On mobile, I see lots of very ""small"" games. Ketchapp's games are a good example of this. They're the sort of thing that make flappy Bird look only slightly uncomplicated. But the graphics are charming, and the gameplay is tight and fun. There were lots of flash games like that. I have fond memories of that game where you drove your armored vehicle around, hit things, then bounced on things. It's hard writing something with examples when you can't even remember their names.   But the other type of mobile game I see is very large games. Maybe not large in terms of complexity; I don't think anyone is going to put their score at Game of War on their r√©sum√©, unless they're trying to prove they're already rich and don't need the job they're applying for as some odd negotiation tactic. These games are the ones with timers, energy (although plain old energy seems to kind of be a relic of the days of Facebook games), and Reddit's dreaded in-app purchases. Honestly, I'm not that against in-app purchases. For most games, they really feel like paying for cheat codes which some people are against, but I never used cheat codes outside of the GTA series so it doesn't really affect me too much.   However, these games are kind of infamous for making you want to do well in the game (because, well, that's the point of a game usually) and making that only possible if you can outspend your rivals. But I'm not even going to complain about that. What I'm mad about is that all those games have flooded the market and they're all so similar, competing for your time and money. Even if I had all the time in the world, I only have the patience for one or two of those games. I see all these high download count games and think to myself ""Why are they playing Clash of Warchiefs when they can be playing Battle of Valor?"". But that's what I miss about flash games. There were so many that were right in the middle when it came to how much time they expected from you. Roguelites, RPGs that are short by RPG standards, strategy games, Things that you could play a lot, or just a little of. Of course those still exist on mobile, but a lot of times they cost money (although not really a problem with Google's refund policy) and I have a lot of trouble finding them. With flash games I could just go to the highest rated games on Kongregate, Armor Games and Newgrounds and there's be good stuff.   TL;DR: there are a lot of really small arcade games of mobile and there are a lot of MMO Style Games That demand all your attention.

602,"What should I do with this landlord Hi everyone,   My girlfriend is currently live in Copenhagen and she is renting a room in the apartment. It's a 2-bedroom apartment with 2 tenants renting them, so it's like a shared apartment.   The thing is that her landlord, not only often, but always sleeps there, sometimes on the couch or in the other tenant's bedroom. (My girlfriend has a smaller bedroom)  This is not all. Lately, the landlord (who is a transgender, by the way, but I don't want to make this about gender orientation) always has her friends over. On a normal afternoon, they always talk so loudly. Sometimes, they even went out together and came back drunk and continued partying at 3-4 in the morning. Also, they eat anything that's in the fridge. Well, the landlord sometimes cooks for everyone in the apartment. But when she share her stuffs doesn't mean that she could go ahead and use whatever that belongs to other people, right?  One other thing is about the privacy. Opening the doors without knocking is a normal situation in this apartment. From middle to the end of March, my girlfriend came to Germany to visit me. After she went back, she noticed that her stuffs, e.g. water filter, face cleanser, went missing from her room, and appeared in the living room which is a shared area.   Well, the good thing is that my girlfriend is moving out at the end of this month.",0,set2

If yes, then we turn out to be really good (and close) friends, or else I let them go (basically 'ghost' them) for not suffering the pain in the long run (although letting them go is really agonizing, but only in the short run).

622,"I gave up Reddit for Lent, and this is what I learned For the last couple years or so, I've been active on Reddit almost every day. Gradually, Reddit became the only thing I did for fun on my phone. I've never been that into games, and I've abandoned most other social apps. And I don't regret that. Reddit is awesome. But it became a source of daily comfort for me, and therefore when it came time to give something up for Lent, it just made sense. My wife and I aren't particularly religious, but we decided to do Lent this year as an exercise in self control. So I deleted the Reddit app off my phone and removed it from my Chrome bookmarks, and beyond a thread popping up in the odd Google search, I haven't read a word of Reddit content for the last 47 days. And here is what the experience has taught me:  1. Facebook is a BUMMER. If you want to be pissed off at the world, irritated at people you like, and annoyed by irrelevant ads, go to Facebook. But without Reddit to kill those small increments of time we spend waiting for things, I turned to this old standby. Facebook has sucked for a long time, but I keep it for other people's sake. Most of the older generation of my family can barely stomach the idea of Facebook, and to them switching to something else is about like switching from cars to rocket ships as their primary means of transportation. They had a hard enough time switching to Facebook from their hand-written address books. I love these people, and I want to stay in touch with them, and I cannot in good conscience ask them to abandon the fragile comfort they've found in the digital age. So when it comes to sharing pics and videos of my daughter, a private Facebook group allows everyone to participate. But for me, as a way of killing 5-10 minutes, Facebook is about equal to self-flagellation.  2. I miss reading books. Without social media to kill time, I turned to ebooks. I discovered that Google's Play Books app is actually really powerful, and the Play Store has a huge library of classic books for bargain prices. I stocked up on a bunch of bucket list items, and even dove into a few heady volumes that have been on my shelves for a while. For the first time in years, I'm actively reading 5 books. I've always been one of those multiple-books-at-once people, but in the past couple years Reddit usurped that reading time. I like to have different books for different reading spots: one for each bathroom in my house, and one for bedtime. And I like to have different ebooks for different spans of time. If I have 5 minutes to kill, I'll page through a comic book. If I have an hour or more, I'll read Plato or Proust. Over the last 47 days I've rediscovered my interest in reading, and I was surprised to find I didn't miss the stuff I read on Reddit at all. Which leads me to the next thing I learned.  3. What I miss about Reddit is having a place to post things. I'm not particularly witty, and I don't really have a strong need for attention, but every now and then I will happen to come up with a meme, or shower thought, or discussion topic that my Facebook friends might not get, but that the wider internet would probably like. And Facebook is a terrible place to post that kind of stuff. It won't appear in most of your friends' feeds, and the ones who see it will either ignore it, or they won't understand it, and will post some awkward comment forcing you to explain your joke/reference, and the whole thing becomes exhausting. This post is a perfect example. Most of my Facebook friends don't even know what Reddit is, so they wouldn't understand. And virtually none of them would bother reading a post of this length.  4. The other thing I miss about Reddit is those rare, valuable moments where you really make a connection with someone. This is one of those areas where the anonymity of Reddit really works in your favor. Here, people are much more bold with the things they're willing to discuss because the social consequences of vulnerability are virtually non-existent. I follow a few support-group-ish subs, and on more than one occasion I've been able to jump straight into a deep conversation without all the awkwardness and small talk that gets in the way in real life. Even online, when you're talking to people you know, every relationship has baggage that prevents you from getting real with people. Here you can skip that. Don't get me wrong, Reddit is still 99% mental junk food. Hell, the whole internet is. But at least here there aren't any built in barriers to deep conversation.  So now that it's Easter, I'm back. And I'll probably still use Reddit every day. But it's not going to be like it was. The mindless content browsing? I didn't miss that at all. If I have 5 mins to kill, maybe. But any more time than that, and I'd rather be reading. And when I'm here, I'm going to try to focus on more meaningful interactions. I'll probably never have a life completely free of mental junk food, but I've learned that I never really liked it as much as I thought I did.",0,set2

Well one of the steps to ridding yourself of your bad habit was to find the underlying cause/reason that you participate in this habit. So I did some thinking. Why do I watch youtube/browse reddit so much. And the answer is quite simple. I use it to fill the missing social interaction in my life. I don't have any close friends, so to make up for it I watch videos/read reddit to feel that connectedness. When I do these things I feel like I am a part of a group, like there are other people out there who understand me and would be friends with me.

I use Spotify and the native Apple app (for mixtapes and CD‚Äôs that you can‚Äôt stream) and I was super overwhelmed by the sheer amount of music I had amassed. My Spotify looks like this - https://imgur.com/a/ljCfy  Each playlist has between 50-300 songs on it. I had to create more to separate out my music because I‚Äôd have playlists with different genres and sounds in it, and it was just a weird listening experience.  So, to my question!   How do you all organize what you listen to? Do you break it down by release years? Genres? Etc?

I've been having some trouble with my parents; more specifically, them giving me more freedom with various aspects of my life.  Usually, they're pretty cool with this kind of thing, like if I wanted to go out with friends, but with technology, they have this stigma.  In particular, I want more freedom with my phone, or at least the ability to keep it in my room at night.  They have their own reasons for not letting me, but this policy was put into place a few years ago (when, truthfully, I wasn't getting enough sleep).  Now, I know the value of sleep, but I just wish they weren't so on top of me about when I do go to sleep or wake up.  Additionally, their attitude that it's improper to text in bed is a bit archaic to me.  I certainly understand their point of view but I just think it's a new age now and... why does it matter if I text at my desk or in bed?  My bed is way comfier than my chair.  I know this will sound really entitled/spoiled, but I just wish they cared less about me and what I do.

642,"Went on a hike today (#87) My dad's old college buddy likes to go on hikes and he sends out mass invites to people about every other month to join him. I always was interested in going on a hike so back in November my dad asked me to tag along at it was fun. He did the same for today and it was again fun and quite an adventure.  Two other people who showed up last time (excluding me, my dad, and his friend) were there today as were three different people. My dad's friend and the one lady who showed up both times bring their dogs along (he owns a fat dachshund named Ella and she owns a golden retriever named Koby). Except for crossing a couple of water creeks, Ella is able to do the entire hike by herself despite her size and stumpy legs. Koby runs back and forth over and over and over and he often lays in puddles/water or rolls around in dirt. They make the hikes so much more fun.  We actually got lost today somehow. Apparently this crew often crosses from path to path instead of staying on the same one all the time (cause they always go to the same park so it'd get boring doing it that way) and when we switched to one path, even though we all thought there was only one possible direction to go, we went the wrong way. We managed to find our way back and eventually got to the cars. The hike started at 10am and (including a few short breaks and a far too long lunch break) we finished at 6pm. We apparently did around 6.5 miles according to one of the guy's hiking app. A lot of it was uphill but that's not much of a problem.  I haven't run much at all the past few months so my cardio is kinda shit right now (screw treadmills even though I'm in the gym 3-4 times a week) so it was a bit tiring at some points, but I could have kept going for much longer I felt. Or at least without the breaks. But since everyone else in the hiking group is somewhere between their mid-30s to late-50s, not everyone was as energetic as I was. My dad's friend has two bad knees and so when the painkillers wore off he really needed to rest more and more.   When I actually have free time when the semester ends to get a life, I would like sign up for hikes using the MeetUp app so I could hopefully hike with people more around my age (since I can't really find any of my own friends who'd be interested) because hiking definitely is a fun thing to do. I love the outdoors.  Do you ever do activities with your parents for fun? (or did you back when you lived at home if you don't anymore)  What are your thoughts on hiking?

The longer I watched her switch back and forth between the sides (there's a platform with my desk just above the floor), the more I thought it was a cockroach (something I loathed as much).   Well, something went near the boxes I've yet to put away (oh, how I'm going to HATE cleaning it now). My cat, Monsoon, was sniffing quite a bit in the corner. That was when I went to get a hardcover book, preparing for the worst. Oh, I thought it was a cockroach all right. I shined my phone light where it was likely to come out. My room's pretty small so I had to be quick before it reaches under my bed.  But no....  What came around? Well, first I heard it. It was crawling out all right. Slow and steady. I was ready. Then I heard the orange bag that was on my floor begin to make creasing sounds. Like something...heavy. I saw it, right then. He was a big one all right. But oh no, not a cockroach...a freaking wolf spider. I could only mouth what the heck before Monsoon made a dash for it.   It KNEW what was going to happen. Never did I actually encounter a wolf spider in my room before and it was HUGE. Just scurried off as Monsoon tried pawing after it (she doesn't go under the bed, of course. Lazy cat.). I about wigged out yelling at Monsoon, ""Kill it!"". Stood on a chair and everything to make me feel ok. Then my Aunt came in to help, tried to take it out with a shoe at one point, to which it jumped about a foot in the air, making us scurry out of our room. Apparently she didnt mind them but I might have freaked her out a little. I get fearfully excitable if that makes sense. Because I was so busy running out of the danger zone, I don't know where it's at now. We looked in the closet. We looked under my bed and all things to look under.

687,"Designer clothes (#85) I was talking to one of my friends earlier about clothes for a little bit. Her family has more money than most of our friend group but she is super humble about it and not many people are even aware since she doesn't flaunt it. However, when she goes shopping she does tend to go for the big designer brands because she can afford it. She always offers to pay for everything for everyone though because she understands that she is more fortunate financially than most of her friends and she doesn't like seeing people suffer money wise or in any other way. I always try to refuse when she does this just cause I'm not a fan of people spending money on me. I also joke and tell her that I always go straight for the clearance racks when I am out shopping (which ins't really that much of a joke since I do honestly do that, but it's just fun to joke about with her). She was saying tonight that we should go shopping together for our athletic banquet in May and she said we won't go to the super expensive stores even though she wants to get me designer type clothes/items. I told her that for the past three years I've gone to TJMaxx and gotten my dress for the banquet there.  I personally have never been a fan of designer clothing. All of the big names in women's fashion (that I'm even aware of because I know barely any names) just don't look cute to me whereas the more affordable stuff generally looks better and fits nicer on me.   This could also stem from the fact that I just automatically put down anything that has a big price tag as unappealing to me. Growing up my parents struggled to pay bills and I watched as my dad worked his ass off to get every promotion possible to be able to get a bigger paycheck; he even needed to get a second job for a while. My brother really liked the Nike Air Jordan sneakers and would buy them constantly, to the point where my parents would yell at him about money. Me, leading a life where my entire goal was to avoid being yelled at, saw this and determined that spending money was a bad thing so I always saved. Not to mention the recession started when I was about 10/11ish and I still think we're in it even though I know we're not. These are just some of all the factors that have made me someone who watches my money a bit too closely. Designer brands are beyond luxury and I have no interest in ever getting them for myself.   Also some girl made fun of me in high school for not knowing who Tory Burch was and when I googled it later in the day I saw that those clothes were really ugly and expensive personally.

I haven't eaten red meat in weeks (not a fan of pork) but haven't felt too off about chicken. I've been eating seafood without guilt.   I have seen documentaries like Food Inc. and whatnot, but damn.

697,"I hope someone reads this, even if its one person. I want to get some stuff off my chest, it's too much to tell my family so they won't know why I am killing myself I feel like a literal dysfunction of the brain. I've been mentally and physically abused from a very young age until I was 7, although, it still felt like quite a normal life. When my dad left and I was just being raised by my mom it was the best time of my life. As sad as it is, from 7 until 13 was the only time I ever had friends. Actual genuine friends who I had fun with and considered family. During this time though was when one of the contributors to my fucked up brain was coming to fruition. My brother introduced me to porn, when I was very young. He taught me how to masturbate and that evolved into me and him masturbating under his sheets together. Then one day he proposed the idea that we jack each other off while we were taking a bath. (forgot to mention he is 3 years older than me) This caused me to have a fucked up psychological state for a long time. I thought I was gay for a long time even though I knew a hundred percent I was attracted to women. I have fucked up sexual desires due to this. I'm attracted to my fucking cousin. I'm not gonna go into more depth about this because it's too painful being self aware of the fucked up thoughts I have. Anyways, we moved to Jakarta when I was in grade 7, that's when my social life ended. All my traumas came back and I just couldn't socialize. It was terrifying and I ended up becoming addicted to my computer. I had no friends for 2 years and only superficial relationships with other losers. In my freshman year I took some action and went out to parties. Went out a few times drinking until I met some other people that were pretty cool, I still kept up a fake persona so I could not connect with anyone. Drank at least once a week. Then I moved to Kyiv in grade 10, my first school I went to was terrible. All my fault, because I ruined it for myself, I closed myself in with defensive walls, and was an unintentional asshole causing everyone to hate me. I dropped out to do online courses suddenly by just not showing up to school one day. My mom allowed me to do that because she noticed the dire situation I was in. The online courses turned into me spending a whole year in one room without leaving almost ever. I played games and watched movies and youtube videos. I coped with my shitty life by drowning in dopamine giving tools on my laptop. My mom went crazy throughout the year because I was failing the online courses and was just fucking around. In this year I met one guy, I'll call him Owen. Me and Owen weren't really friends. Just two losers who got together because we were rejected by all others. Me and him smoked a lot of weed together. I don't know why I smoked weed because every time I did I became extremely anxious and closed off. He witnessed my mental decline first hand. He definitely noticed I was not okay. We also discovered hard drugs that year. We met some guy that became our drug dealer one night when we were searching for a strip club. One thing led to another and we met some ukrainian pimp who also deals drugs. The first time I asked him if he had ecstasy he said yea, and when we actually got it, it was some paper with a MOUND of white powder. We didn't know it was speed at the time, we had absolutely no idea what we were taking. We didn't snort it, we ate the speed. The night started out, we felt the effects about 20 minutes in. It was crazy. Too fucking crazy. I started talking non stop. I think I was repeating the word fuckin all throughout the night. The most terrifying thing was that we both blacked out for a majority of the night, and my mom was about 10 meters away in her room. He stopped talking, all night he became a mute. I was terrified. I thought he had lost his mind. So I panicked and was trying to get him to say something, literally anything. It was a clusterfuck. We could have easily OD'd that night, the fucking drug dealer was trying to get us hooked so we would be recurring customers. I black out, and then I hear my moms voice at 8am in the morning. As soon as I hear her voice I snap out of the trance. Still fucked, I had to go to the store with her and her friends. We went and as we were going I was trying to keep my cool although still tripping hard. Anyways I did it just fine, my friend stayed at my place and said he saw ghosts. I did this stuff a few more times, it got to the point where I starting picking through the carpet, looking for anything that ever resembles speed to get another hit. I stopped myself before it got too bad. Then we discovered ecstasy. Oooooh man is ecstasy wonderful. It is honestly one of the highlights of my life. Still gonna do it again sometime soon. When we started out we did it too often. Like once or twice a week. I'd be trying to trick my mom into giving me my allowance by changing the progress bar on the website of my online school. It worked a few times. After bingeing a lot we decided to take it easy. We did some research on how to roll safely, and tried. I still pop molly to this day but a lot less frequently. The molly was also pretty bad, it contributed to my intense depression. After a year of absolute hell, I was ready. After only socializing with Owen and my mom for a year I wanted to be better. This time I was gonna be outgoing and have lots of friends. I started school again at the other international school. My first day was cringe but far better because I was optimistic. To give you an idea I introduced myself to a group of guys in my grade, nearly my whole grade, and when they asked where I was from I said, ""I'm white""(I met some other guys that were pretty cool though"". Now we're at the part of the story where I am living now. I've made a decent amount of friends. Still don't consider them close friends. More like school friends. I've blocked myself off with my ""Defensive walls"" again, and this time people don't hate me they are just weirded out by me. Still though, I'm proud of what I've achieved. I get invited to parties, and what not. I still feel empty though. I feel like I want to improve myself but I don't have the energy to do so. Even if I wanted to, I would be working at a lost cause, because I feel that due to my experience my brain is deteriorating and I am incapable of being who I want to be. I'll never become someone I'll be proud of. I'll never be proud of myself. And above all. I am literally unable to have a human connection. I've lost touch with family. Even the mom I live with, I do not connect with her. I've lost 99.9% of my social skills. I am beyond salvageable. I feel like all of that can be fixed by just erasing myself from this world. Death is natural. I do not belong and that's fine with me. My existence will only cause more problems in the future, for my family and for those around me. My children will have my dna, which will leave them handicapped. We are all part of the game of life, natural selection is selecting against me. I guess I am just not meant to be. I am going to kill myself, but I am letting this come to the grave with me. I just needed to tell someone, just needed to get it off my chest so at least one person could see this. I feel like an asshole for killing myself, because I know it will cause immense pain for my mom and my brother (which I do not hold any grudges against despite what he did, he was young stupid and also traumatised), I hope they will understand, and if not I will explain when we meet again where this fucked up life of mine is out of the picture.",1,set2

Not important but oh man I want to move.  Today I was on the 6 train heading downtown. As we were pulling into 14th street/Union Square the train conductor started making announcements as required explaining what stop we're at and what transfers are available. I was only half paying attention because I had headphones on but I did hear her say "".. 42nd street with connections to the 7 and shuttle to Times Square ... "" and I thought that was odd because I had gotten on the train at 42nd street so I should've been much further away. Then there was a pause where she must have realized her mistake and then started saying the correct stop and all the trains you could transfer to. But what made this great was she was laughing the entire time. Her laugh was so genuine and hearty too which made me smile but when I quickly glanced around the subway car, nobody else seemed to be paying any mind to what was being said. For the rest of the time I was on the train she got herself under control and correctly announced all the other stops.  I just found that moment to be a particularly nice thing that happened today. I have no idea what was going through her head that made her confuse the stations but she owned it and was able to laugh it off.

711,"Do you think it's condescending to tell a child 'Your parents raised you well'? I remember my mother telling me off when I was eleven for going to school with muddy trousers. I'd played a bit of rugby after school and wore the same trousers the next day without washing them because I didn't consider it much of a problem at the time. My mum was upset that I hadn't washed them or wore clean ones, and when it was clear that I didn't understand the problem at all, she threw in that it also makes teachers think that she's not looking after me. I didn't understand this at the time, because in my mind it was my responsibility to wash my clothes not hers, but as I got older this memory stuck with me and I realised it's the truth. The way a child acts and appears reflects massively on the parents, but as a child I didn't view it that way.  So my question comes from last night. I was playing the game *Fortnite Battle Royale*, and for those not familiar with the game you can get paired up with three other strangers and have to work together to beat all the other teams. Teamwork is essential, and using your microphones to chat is also really useful.  I was paired up with a twelve-year-old boy and two American college students. I don't usually like playing with children, but this kid was pretty polite and a nice guy to play with. He wasn't good at the game, but he did his best to share all the items he got with the team and gave us all the info he had so no problems there.  Something that bugged me though is that the two other guys repeatedly told him 'your parents raised you well' whenever he said please/thank you or helped us out. He always replied with an awkward laugh and a 'thanks', but to me, it seems condescending to say that kind of thing. I didn't speak up at the time because that would make things awkward.

Assuming that global political and economical system is more or less the same (maybe, more civility), what would be the legal and political grounds for Martian society?  Private companies like SpaceX probably will be on the forefront of exploration, with state agencies tailing them closely. So, the first stations/settlements probably will be organized by a bunch of different state and private agents like ISS and operate in the same framework? But the astro/kosmonauts on ISS only stay for a short time, and even then US and Russian space agencies basically decide everything for them. Permanent settlers would probably want to have a voice in development of the colony. But imagine if SpaceX funded 50% of the mission and sent 2 permanent settlers, whereas NASA shelled out for another 50% and sent 10. Would they all have the same vote, or SpaceXers will be more ""valuable"" so to speak?  Moreover, what if someone commits a crime while in such a colony? With no police and united legal framework (maritime law???) how the punishment or retribution will be decided upon? Furthermore, people would probably engage in some sort of economic exchange. How and through what could it be regulated? And should it be regulated?  History provides is with some perspective on distant colonies where people dumped something/someone they did not want that much (sorry, Oz), as well as resource-valuable colonies governments and private companies competed for, but Martian situation is quite different from both. Or not?   What kind of culture / sentiment towards ""mainland"" and its separated governments life in such colony would create?

The part where the guy is on his knees and the girl walks around him - the way she looks at him was so cute. I know it's just part of the choreo, but it was like ""I wish I could find someone who looked at me like that"". They both seemed to have so much fun in the choreo, and as I watch more and more of their videos, I start to daydream about myself being a choreographer at that studio and being friends with all of them there. They have a big social media presence and it looks like they all have a blast working there, so I kept imagining myself in all the pictures and videos I've seen and being friends with all of them. Even in the link earlier, I imagined myself being the guy in the video (it's his choreo) and creating other awesome dance choreos.

782,"Trying to figure out how to live a life worth living when nobody seems to want to care or even acknowledge that I exist. No matter what I do, I can't seem to find anyone who will care about me. In my early 20s I had this same exact problem but I was in college, so people couldn't ignore me completely. My professor had to give me assignments and my classmates had to work with me on group projects. Sure, my professors barely gave me any feedback or praise even though I got As on just about everything, and my classmates did the bare minimum of interacting with me even though I always did most of the work on the project and compensated for group members that neglected to do their fair share - but at least they had to acknowledge that I was a living human being that could be talked to and would talk back in return.  Back then I was so annoyed by all that. But things were so much better than they are now.  I feel absolutely invisible. I cannot find anyone to care about the fact that I exist. I can go on a depression forum and post about how I feel and some well-meaning strangers with no intention of actually getting to know me will show up and say those same canned phrases - you matter, you're important, people care about you, don't kill yourself. And it's very nice of them to freely give up their time to respond to strangers on the internet like that, but unfortunately it doesn't help me feel any better. They don't know me, they don't want to know me, they won't ever know me. What I need is proof that one other human being will get to know me and care for me, at least to the point where they would miss me if I were gone. I have no one like that. It's probably been over five years since I had anyone like that.  I keep trying to figure out if there's some way for me to have a fulfilling life, even when no one will care about me. Maybe I could start caring for a bunch of animals, and make their happiness my goal in life, and maybe that would be enough. Or maybe if I make my life all about learning, the pursuit of knowledge would be enough to make up for the fact that I don't exist to anyone else. I ended up getting a cat and watching a ton of documentaries over the last few months. I love my cat, and she's probably the main reason I'm still alive, but she's less of a reason to stay and more of a reason why I can't go. And now I know a bunch more about Greek culture and World War II and the development of the computer, but it doesn't make up for the fact that I'm completely alone. I feel like a spaceman observing a planet from orbit, learning about all these other people and societies but never having a chance to interact with them.  So I have yet to figure out what I can do. It's gotten to the point where I fantasize about killing myself for attention. I used to think that sort of thing was just completely nonsensical, but it makes perfect sense to me now. I've been ignored and abandoned by so many people that killing myself might kill two birds with one stone. I'd be putting an end to a pointless, go-nowhere life and also possibly getting someone to actually acknowledge that I exist(ed).  A lot of people say the world doesn't owe anyone anything. And maybe that's true. But if it's really the case that this is just the way things have to be for me, then I don't really want to hang around. If the world doesn't owe me the opportunity to make a single friend, then I don't owe the world the ability to live guilt-free for abandoning me. Killing myself is really the only option left for getting at least a single person to take notice. At this point even that might be wishful thinking.  Growing up, it never crossed my mind that this is what life would be like.",1,set2

You can pick only the ones you know if you don't know some of them.  * Quentin Tarantino or Tim Burton?  * Kevin Smith or Zack Snyder?  * Nancy Meyers or Kathryn Bigelow?  * Wes Craven or John Carpenter?  * James Wan or David Cronenberg?  * Sam Raimi or Guillermo Del Toro?  * Michael Bay or Rolland Emmerich?  * Steven Spielberg or Wes Anderson?  * Judd Apatow or Adam Mckay?  * Edgar Wright or John Hughes?  * Hayao Miyazaki or John Lasseter?  * Brad Bird or Andrew Stanton?,0,set2

825,"Does anyone else hate April Fool's Day? With April 1st coming up I'm really not looking forward to it. I personally can't stand it, it's basically ""don't trust anything anyone does or says day"". I'd prefer not to have to watch out for people playing jokes or pranks on me around every corner. Now it's weird, because I'm not opposed to being pranked in general(as long as it's not the idiotic, harmful ""internet style"" of pranks of course), but having a day that's pretty much dedicated to pranking takes away the point of it. Pranks are supposed to be unexpected and take people off guard, they lose effect if the person is on their guard all day expecting to be pranked, which is generally the case on April Fool's Day.

I actually tried to make a complaint but that got me nowhere fast. I asked to see a supervisor at the VA and they were basically like, ""no ones coming"".....

842,"A social trend I've noticed, really like and wanted to share. Hello CC!  I'll try to make this a quick and easy read without too much filler.  It all started when I was eight... jk  I first noticed it last year around august when I worked a private security gig for a friends wedding. All of the people there were the high end, upper-crust types. I remember the bride and groom and most of their friends were performers in that circus show in Las Vegas whose name I always forget, their parents were land developers all over the US, and the guests were all very well off.  Me being of a more modest lifestyle (broke-ass mofo) I felt pretty out of place with the crowd and for a while I feet I was the only non-white person there. I was convinced that I was sticking out like a sore thumb. Nobody there knew me, it was actually my first time meeting any of the people there other than my friend. I felt like I made everyone uncomfortable by being present all the time. I stood at the table of honor with my friend and even wound up in some of the family pictures.  Right, I was going for brevity.  Anyway the entire wedding goes off with only a few hitches and as we are saying our good-byes to the happy couple they thank me for helping out and then they invite me to their family-only party, IN PERFECT SPANISH!  I know I probably shouldn't be as shocked by that as I was but I still found it crazy cool that they spoke spanish. I don't mean the blocky and awkward spanish from high school that you forgot immediately after graduating. These kids were speaking it as if they had just moved in from Guadalajara. They had a small accent but other than that they spoke like a native.  I complimented them on their spanish and they said that they had picked it up from their nannies who would speak to them almost exclusively in spanish growing up.  I went to the party and wound up having a great time, we would throw little jabs back and forth and I found that they didn't just speak the language, they had the mannerisms and nuances of mexican culture down too.Most of the staff was mexican and they all got along really well. Typically when I meet staff of wealthy home owners staff rarely like the people they work for but this was not the case here.  Since I've gotten to know more of my friends friends I have noticed the same thing with their kids who either speak spanish or some other language that they pick up from their nannies\house keepers\gardeners. I also notice that people who have formed these connections with their ethnic employees tend to be much more respectful towards ethnic people or people of different tax brackets.  So what is the point of this super brief and concise post?  I feel that even with all the crap that we see in the news and online, despite the general feel of having to fear everyone out there who is remotely different and regardless of those who go out of their way to spread hatred and bigotry; society as a whole is moving towards a more progressive, accepting and open future and I really hope I live long enough to see it.

873,"How do you feel about handing toddlers iPads, smartphones, or any other kind of smart devices to keep them entertained? You've seen them, children between 3-8 with tablets that barely fit in their small hands playing games/watching children's content.  On one hand it's 2018 and the way we live our lives by choosing what to do with our time will get influenced by what technology we have available. Of course this is true for both adults and children. What's wrong with kids watching barney on their parents' phones during a long road trip? Not to mention that should they wish, they can use that phone to learn new things on the fly. An exciting new frontier for education.  On the other hand, children at that age are rapidly developing their cognitive function so by ""spoiling"" them of content, parents are irresponsibly depriving them of unique experiences that brings with it a unique lesson that's invaluable to their character. This is different from Television in that now you can potentially be on a device every waking moment of your childhood.  I'm in the latter camp personally, I've never liked seeing kids with screens in their hands all the time. Although obviously there's merit in the words ""everything in moderation.""",0,set2

879,"I drove a random stranger back to their home. Settle down folks, this is gonna be a long one!  It was a Thursday morning about three or four weeks ago and I was sat in my Pharmacology class slowly feeling the impeding doom of an anxiety attack. I was toying with the idea of ditching the class I had after lunch and going home to play some video games in hopes of making my day better. Lunch time rolls around and I decide to go home, I pick up my favourite salad and drive home.   I'm about to dig in when I think to myself M1chael_Burnham, this could tastes 100 times better if you inhaled some dead plant smoke. So I quickly roll up and head outside to smoke. As I'm walking around the corner (my apartment block is on the corner of a busy main road and a dead end, I prefer to smoke on the dead end road) I see a girl across the road looking lost and I start repeating ""please don't ask for directions"" quietly to myself. I stupidly make eye contact with her and she shouts across the road asking where she was. Being the nice person I am I decide to explain to her, ""you're on Discovery"". I chuckled myself as I found myself in a situation I didn't want to be in, but that was fine. She crosses the street and she explains that she isn't a local, she looked desperate, lost and scared. I ask her where she's from and she tells me she's from a town that's 30mins away and then she just started bawling her eyes out explaining that she had been spiked the night before and had spent the most part of the day locked in a strange man's room. She'd just had to push the guy out of the way with the door as he came back into the room and just ran until she found me. She asked if she could use my phone to call a friend, he didn't pick up. I asked her if she wanted to get the police involved because I know some people are a bit iffy about policemen/women. She immediately says no, I then suggest giving her directions to the nearest bus station and she says she has no money, she only had a very old Nokia phone on her and she was wearing a hoodie, leggings and some Nikes. As I looked closely at her I noticed visible bruises on her wrists & back of neck, I really wanted to call the police but I also didn't want to make her feel like she cannot trust me. We tried calling her friend again and there was no answer. As I'm looking around me I see my car parked on the road and I just blurt out that I'll take her home since it's only a 30min drive. I immediately regret it as I realise I'm inviting a complete stranger into my car, I further explain that I'll only take her if a friend of mine comes with us, just to be safe and she was fine with that. If anything she was grateful.   We jump in the car, pick up my friend (who happened to be about a mile away luckily). I offered the girl some breakfast bars I keep in my car for homeless people and she just devoured them, like she hadn't eaten in days. Again I think about calling the police so I  ask her her age just to make sure I'm not driving a minor and she says sh2es 22, I didn't believe her but she had an expired provisional license on her which confirmed her age. I made sure to drive as safe as possible because I didn't want to have a car crash or something with a total stranger in the car, how would I explain that one!?  We get to her house and her friend we'd tried calling earlier was standing outside visibly freaked out (I think they'd been out together the night before) he was very grateful for bringing her back. I gave the girl my number just to keep in contact and she said she'd call or text to let me know how she's doing. She didnt.   I feel stupid, like I got played/lied to. On the other hand I couldn't just leave her to fend for herself because if I had been in her situation I'd want help too.  I don't know if I'm over thinking it but I feel like I shouldn't have taken her home, that I should have called the police and had them help her. No one but my boyfriend and the friend who came with me know, and I guess you guys now. Was I wrong? Should I have left her? Should I have called the police?

905,"Meeting up with old friends (#93) ^^^^I'd ^^^^like ^^^^to ^^^^state ^^^^that ^^^^I ^^^^started ^^^^writing ^^^^this ^^^^before ^^^^midnight ^^^^so ^^^^ha  Today me and five friends from high school met up for the first time together in over a year. When I was in high school I became really close with a group of girls who were a year ahead of me and they're really the only people from my high school I keep in touch with (despite going to such a small school where everyone knew each other). We're always so busy though so it's hard to get everyone together. We were meeting for dinner at an hip Italian food place which I originally wasn't excited for because I've had Italian food too often than I'm not interested in it.  Anyway, so I worked out at school before I met up with any of them and I was going to meet up with one person around noonish. When I called her it turned out we were on complete opposite sides of Manhattan. So instead of being smart and picking a spot to meet up at we decided to walk along an avenue until we found each other. This entailed a lot of back and forth and phone calls asking ""where are you"" until I finally told her don't move and I'll come to you. We then went to get food and had awesome bacon burgers and then we walked through Central Park.  In the park we went up and down so many paths and eventually got near the area where I always practiced for cross country so I showed her around there. We started at the south east corner and when we were finally leaving the park we were at the north west corner (and it was fun with how we left because I didn't feel like looking for a path that actually would leave out the park and so we climbed down a hill to one of the exits instead).  Then we took the subway down to around China Town and walked uptown to get ice cream at a place that makes ice cream rolls. Then we walked to The Strand book store (probably the biggest independent bookstore in Manhattan) and we walked around there for a while. I bought a couple of books, a pair of corgi socks, and an improv game.  Finally it was around the time we were supposed to meet everyone so we waited at a park and collected our group then went over to the Italian food place. It was hard to find seating for all six of us but we managed to get a table and then when we got our food (it was a counter-service style place, not a normal Italian restaurant) the chef was super chill and making jokes with us as she prepared our food. The food was so much better than I was expecting. We all talked and talked for a while since it's been so long since most of us had seen each other. We started playing the improv game (it's called Human Beings if you're curious) and we had a bunch of fun with that. Then we got desert at a gelato place (I got hot chocolate since I love that and I already had ice cream earlier in the day). While we were just chilling on a bench outside the gelato place I did one of my trademark activities with my friends which is: read passages of a book that are totally normal in a really seductive voice. That is always fun and turns into a wild ride. We then realized it was 10pm and passed some of our bedtimes (we're old ladies despite all being 21-23) and so we headed for the subway. Only one of my friends lives near me so she took the train all the way with me and then my dad dropped her off at home instead of having her wait for the bus she had just missed.  It was so fun catching up with all of my friends. Even though we have diverse interests (and I personally cannot mention my political opinions around them since they differ so much) we all love and support each other and are all amazed by what everyone is doing. We were all the nerds in high school and still have maintained ourselves well as the years have gone on. We can have such long and deep conversations about basically anything and it's awesome. We're all entering actual adulthood now with everyone graduating/going into grad school/getting full time jobs and it's so crazy how when we all became friends our biggest worries were tests and papers.

910,"Confused about grad school and life in general Today I got accepted into a very prestigious American university for a graduate healthcare degree. I didn‚Äôt think I was going to get in, but I actually got accepted with a scholarship. Even with the scholarship though, it‚Äôs very expensive.   My wife and I are very economically conservative despite having high paying jobs in our mid 20s. That being said, we can pay entirely for the degree (it‚Äôs part time so I don‚Äôt have to quit my job) using my take home salary alone over the next two years while still paying all of our bills and putting money into a savings account. No loans required.   I applied to this program because I wanted my career to have a chance at being meaningful.  I‚Äôm young, but working in healthcare technology is a very tangible way that I can see myself putting my skills to good use for the benefit of everyone. I currently work in an industry that I do not find meaningful/worthwhile. It pays the bills, but at the end of the day I‚Äôm really only serving myself by earning a paycheck. My work does not make anyone‚Äôs lives better (except maybe our shareholders). I‚Äôm afraid if I stay in this line of work, I will wake up and 30 comfortable years will have gone by and I‚Äôll have made zero contribution to society.   However, my wife thinks the degree is too expensive. I‚Äôve analyzed our financial situation a hundred different ways, and barring any unforeseen drastic changes in our job status or lifestyle (knock on wood, you never know), we can afford this degree. Our savings account won‚Äôt be skyrocketing during it but we can afford it with no loans. We both attended a school for undergrad on a significant scholarship and worked all through college, so we have zero debt at the moment.   I know it‚Äôs expensive. But I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot, that if I WERE to get accepted, what would I do?   I believe that those who are able to help out humanity, in whatever way, should do their part. I believe we have been very blessed - to have no student debt, good jobs, and for me to have gotten accepted into a grad program I never thought I could get into. I believe we are able to do this, and that I can make a difference in someone‚Äôs life somewhere by pursuing this degree. I think that makes it worth it.   Am I crazy for thinking this? At the end of my career I want to have made an impact, to have helped others. I want to leave the world a better place when I die than it was when I was born. There are so many pain points in the American healthcare system. This is an industry that needs innovation and I want to be a part of that effort.   Am I being too idealistic here? Maybe too proud? Am I thinking I‚Äôm ‚Äúnoble‚Äù and ‚Äúheroic‚Äù for wanting to do this, or do you think my heart is in the right place? I would really love to hear anyone‚Äôs thoughts. I really need some insight here. I have to make my decision very soon.   And please be as painfully honest as you can. You will NOT hurt my feelings even if you tell me I‚Äôm an idiot. I promise.

937,"The Jelly Belly Jelly Bean Flavors: RANKED I am somewhat concerned as to how exactly Jelly Belly makes their jelly beans because typically the artificial flavor of the beans are SO strong that it is overwhelming. But necessary if you are eating a variety so that any one flavor can be completely erased from your palette when popping in the next.   My mom had got me a small box of jelly beans for Easter, a variety pack of conventional flavors, and I haven't really eaten these things in years so I thought I'd dip back into my childhood and try them out. Was interested to see that old favorites became today's garbage, and the flavors I used to be meh about have come to the top of my list. Because I‚Äôm kind of drunk and bored I will share list of favorite Jelly Belly jelly beans from the worst bean to the best:  * 20: Licorice  I have yet to understand who actually enjoys licorice. I understand back in the olden days there wasn‚Äôt as much of a variety of flavors so licorice candy maybe was tolerable alongside like star anise and such. I don‚Äôt know how different today‚Äôs licorice extract candy is to the licorice flavorings of yesteryear but it is abrasive and borderline obscene. I wonder if at the Jelly Belly lab, scientists did any form of outreach to have kids taste their beans to evaluate which ones stay in circulation. If they DID, then they would throw licorice out. However I have a hunch that Jelly Belly is one of the few corporations that even buy the root anymore and the licorice industry will surely die off without such a loyal customer. I would hate for licorice farmers to lose their jobs over the retirement of this bean flavor so maybe it‚Äôs for the best that this bean stays. The licorice jelly bean is as deceptively dark as the blueberry jelly bean so I would have to bite the bean first and get a hint of the horrid flavor so I could know to throw this one away. In hind sight, blueberry isn‚Äôt good enough to where this method was worth it. I should have thrown out all dark jelly beans for my own well *bean* hahahahahah get it? Ok,  * 19: Tutti-Frutti  When I was a young warthog, I used to love this fucking flavor. I‚Äôd single out the colorful bean and eat them all last, you know save the best for last and stuff? It‚Äôs a pretty thing to look at I‚Äôll be honest, the pink with flakes of blue and red, a mini mosaic tile. Sadly, getting older, I‚Äôve completely lost the taste for this hyper sugary flavor. It‚Äôs, it‚Äôs almost like bubble gum, a flavor I‚Äôve also gotten sick of. I couldn‚Äôt do it honestly I threw these in the garbage as well. Thankfully easier to pick out than licorice.  * 18: Bubble Gum  No surprise there. But what IS a surprise is that these beans don‚Äôt even taste like bubble gum. Tutti-Frutti tastes more like bubble gum. This is just‚Ä¶off. Askew. It unnerves me.  * 17: Cotton Candy  The pink beans are also suspect and again I don‚Äôt know WHAT the hell they thought they were going for but it doesn‚Äôt taste like any cotton candy I‚Äôve ever had. Isn‚Äôt that bad of a bean but the marketing kind of pisses me off  * 16: Very Cherry  ‚ÄúVery‚Äù should be replaced with ‚ÄúViolent‚Äù. Yeah, that is a better adjective. This bean is VIOLENTLY cherry flavored. In the jungle, bright colors on animals are sometimes a warning sign of poison or toxicity. I should have recognized the literal red flag that is the overwhelming Red of this bean. Seriously the color is concentrated redness. But of course, artificial cherry candy flavored, and so it kind of made me think of cough syrup.  * 15: Blueberry  Similarly, this is‚Ä¶violently blue. Not blueberry, this bean doesn‚Äôt taste like a berry. It tastes ‚Äúblue‚Äù. Didn‚Äôt think blue was a flavor? Think again. The Jelly Belly scientists have found a way to extract the flavor of Blue and condense it into jelly bean form. Is it worth it? It‚Äôs ok I guess, but off putting.  * 14: Watermelon  A favorite summer moment is getting to sit out on the patio, feel the wind blow over me, and look at the trees and the vibrancy of the grass, and snack on grapes and watermelon. I like watermelon. This bean is not watermelon. I don‚Äôt know what actual flavor the artificial watermelon candy extract tries to emulate, but it is so far removed from the actual fruit that every bean I ate made me long for those summer days, for the juiciness and natural flavor of a true watermelon. I cannot wait for those days to return here.  * 13: Green Apple  What is with these fruit jelly beans? They are almost a mockery of the fruits which they imitate. Though it does taste very ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, there is a bit more of a nod toward actual ‚Äúapple‚Äù flavor.  * 12-8: The Citrus Fruits & Peach  Orange Sherbet, Sunkist¬Æ Lemon, Sunkist¬Æ Tangerine, Lemon Lime, and Peach all fall in the middle of the list because all are equally boring. Ironic because citrus fruits have vibrant flavors. Here I just feel meh. I feel so bored every time I‚Äôd pop a yellow or orange bean into my mouth, I‚Äôd think ‚Äúoh boy I bet this will pucker the lips a bit‚Äù and I feel numbness inside of me because I think I am a grown man eating jelly beans alone in his room. I have nothing much to say about each individual flavor.  By the way? I have been calling ‚ÄúOrange Sherbet‚Äù ‚ÄúOrange Sher-bert‚Äù for years now. YEARS. No one has corrected me. I had to type ‚ÄúSherbert‚Äù and get the red squiggly line to alert me that something was wrong.  * 7: Sizzling Cinnamon  The common theme you will see as I get closer to one is that for the most part, the more artificial the flavor is, the more I enjoy it. Which seems counter intuitive to me, I felt that as an adult I would like the fruit ones more. I think rather I appreciate when candy is trying to be candy, and not pretending to be fruit filled. The cinnamon one is good, makes me think of big red which I enjoy. Or like those mints.  * 6: Juicy Pear  An exception to the fruit hate. The actual bean looks a bit sickly, it makes me think of the booger flavored beans in Harry Potter. However, somehow, it works. Somehow, it does feel like a bite of a juicy pear. But better than a pear because pears themselves are somewhat boring, so the added sugar makes it higher on the list than most other fruits.  * 5: Strawberry Cheesecake  Impressionism was an art movement where painters would create scenes that weren‚Äôt fully fledged out in details, literally giving you an ‚Äúimpression‚Äù of a scene. More than that, it was their subjective impression of a scene as well. Similar traits can be heard in the music of Debussy and Ravel, who paint using music to portray impressions of Greek Myths, of foreign lands, etc. etc. I would say this bean is impressionist. It clearly isn‚Äôt a cheesecake. But you get the hint of strawberry, you get the hint of the dessert, and it is almost into the uncanny valley. Something is off, but it‚Äôs ok. This bean was probably crafted by an artist.   From this point forward I‚Äôm willing to say these beans are more examples of Impressionism in food art.  * 4: Coconut  The last fruit in the bundle and it‚Äôs the best. The white bean is a treasure. So simple, and calming, like white foam over the waves, like sand, like, well, a coconut. Biting into this makes me think of sun lotion, of being by the pool, of taking in the warmth of the sun. A bite-sized vacation.  * 3: Pina Colada  This will follow Coconut in description. Eating the cocktail themed bean makes me think of Puerto Rico and indulging in treats I can‚Äôt normally get here at home, feeling more relaxed and happy to be away from it all. Another vacation themed bean.  * 2: Toasted Marshmallow  I don‚Äôt want to know how the Jelly Belly scientists were able to extract the flavor of toasted as well as marshmallow and make it work in a way that isn‚Äôt overwhelming. It is just right, just the right hint of toastiness and marshmallowness. It does make me think of campfires, of looking up at the stars, of shivering in the cold, ghost stories‚Ä¶somehow all of my favorite October memories as a child is recreated through one bean. Kudos.  And finally, the King of Beans:  * 1: Buttered Popcorn  I do not understand how this flavor got to the top of the list. From just the name alone, it feels like a warning sign. Saccharine, unnatural, wrong. But somehow, SOMEHOW, the genius scientists were able to make an icon of movie theater popcorn. And by icon I don‚Äôt mean like ‚Äúthe iconic well known flavor‚Äù, I mean how the Orthodox use it. An ikon is a depiction of God in art, and this bean is an ikon of movie theater popcorn. I don‚Äôt understand how they were able to make a transcendent flavor like this. The scientist, nay, artist, who crafts this bean, probably has a loving family, he or she is probably fulfilled in life, sleeps peacefully. If not, you deserve it sir or madam. You deserve the good things that happen in your life. The life, the light, the love in me honors the life, light, and love in you.  And so ends my time-killer for the day. I hope you‚Ä¶enjoy? This. Also? If anyone from the Jelly Belly corporation is carousing social media for marketing research or whatever, and the title of this post triggers you to read it, know that I will be ready to promote your beans on this site in exchange for a lifetime supply of the following flavors:  * Buttered Popcorn  * Toasted Marshmallow  * Pina Colada  * Coconut  * Strawberry Cheesecake  * Every Licorice bean in circulation  The last isn‚Äôt because I want to eat them, God no, but rather I want to save others from having to come across them.

939,"Does anybody remember MP3Den.com? I think they were active from late 2002 through to 2007, but I guess that was just when I noticed they were gone. I remember back in 2003 I used to go on there to snag songs and burn them to disc so I could play them in the car when my mom drove me to school. My friends wanted in on it, so I started burning discs for them too (I charged them two bucks for an album so I wasn‚Äôt just throwing my money out). But for real though, does anybody remember this site at all? I remember the site looking two different ways. The first one had to have been around 2003-2004. It was stark white and there was a lot of content on screen. I believe the main thing on the page was songs the staff picked to be on the front page. Later on, around 2006, the site got a bit more dark and ‚Äúmodern‚Äù? Lots of red and black, which reflected the time period well enough, considering that was the whole ‚Äúemo revival‚Äù era. The updates were always fun to look forward to, but as time went on they got pretty weird. One of the owners (there were five) made updates telling us what artists and albums he planned to upload to the site (I assume he was buying physical copies and then ripping them to his computer?), but I think he made an update saying he was ending that ‚Äúservice‚Äù. He said it was to make it more mysterious and to keep us on our toes, but I think it was because he wasn‚Äôt buying CDs as much anymore. I remember that one of owners of the site always got strangely personal with his posts, often telling us home details that were sort of TMI. As time went on, the updates got sort of infrequent and shorter. Eventually it just came down to changes he had in mind that he‚Äôd express in one word sentences, sorta bullet point style.   I think we started pissing off the main guy who updated by badgering him about the watermark on every single song. Like seriously, who does that? He did, and it was always a hassle to cut it out before putting it onto disc. Lots of users didn‚Äôt have the technical knowhow to splice it out, but the guy insisted it was important on keeping the ‚Äúintellectual integrity of the site‚Äù (ironic, considering it was bootlegging, right?) I was young back then, so I definitely didn‚Äôt know how to remove them. Eventually I learned to more or less drown them out, and I‚Äôm sure those CDs I made, if any of them are still around, are riddled with that stupid, shitty techno watermark. I swear it‚Äôs almost ingrained in my mind nearly 15 years later. It said ‚Äúwww.mp3den.com, experience it‚Äù, as I recall. The voice was strange, and it was pretty obvious that it was pitch shifted down. It also wasn‚Äôt professional at all, and it was pretty obvious it was one of the owners who made it. I‚Äôm sure if you look hard enough, you could find songs on youtube with that same exact watermark. If you do, let me know!  The forums were always fun, I made a few friends on there. I became close friends with one of the owners, he was always really chill. Occasionally you‚Äôd have the people coming along and calling heresy on the whole site, shouting about how bootlegging was illegal, but they got banned pretty quickly. You‚Äôd also have some guys trying to advertise their own mp3 site, but they never got much attention. I remember a few times there were guys who wanted to put their own music onto the site and they immediately stopped responding once one of the owners pointed out that they wouldn‚Äôt be getting any royalties from it. One guy went so far as to make as many fake accounts as possible and spam the forums hating the site, but they all got banned and eventually he got tired of it.  Looking back on all this, the site seemed shady as hell, but I certainly had a lot of fun on it.

955,"50 days to graduation (#96) ^^^Yeah ^^^yeah, ^^^it's ^^^past ^^^midnight ^^^on ^^^the ^^^east ^^^coast ^^^but ^^^I ^^^got ^^^out ^^^of ^^^work ^^^late ^^^so ^^^shush  Well since it is actually tomorrow now today, I guess I might as well post this. It helps since I had no idea what else to write about and I was saving this post for when it actually was the 50 days to graduation.  Just like 50 days ago, my school is having a small celebration for the seniors for the countdown to graduation. I won't be able to attend it though because I'll be at the fitness center hitting legs at that time; but it is nice to know that the end is so much closer (and also terrifying because I have a lot of catch up to do with my work this semester). In 50 more days I'll be walking across a stadium stage and shaking my college president's hand, looking forward to never sitting behind a desk again.  A year or so ago I had an idea pop into my head that when I hit the 50 days mark to graduation I should do something special and I have been preparing for that the last couple of weeks. You lovely folks get to hear about it first.  I rarely if ever post on Facebook. However, over the next 50 days I am going to write a special shout out to the 50 people/groups that matter most to me and have helped me along the way to get my college degree.   I had no idea how difficult this was going to be. I made an excel sheet to keep track of everything and as of now I only have 16 more people to write my thoughts about. I saved all of them into separate word docs. Those 16 people wont be for another couple of weeks though so I have time to collect my thoughts on them.  There have been a few challenges with this. I didn't realize at first that there weren't 50 individuals I wanted to write something about. It took me some time to get a whole list together of all the individuals/groups of people I wanted to write about. The next issue was finding the right words to use when talking about each person. If that individual has a Facebook I am tagging them and writing most of the post in second person as if I was talking to them directly, but if they don't or if it's more of a group then I am using different language. I also don't know how much to share and not share about a person. I'm trying to keep the posts relatively close in length but some people I just know better and thus will have a larger post.  I'm afraid that some people will be upset if they don't get a personal post, but I also have a few posts dedicated to collective groups (all my XC teammates, the honors program, my relatives, and one or two more) that just about everyone I know will fall under something.  I know that this isn't a very important thing to do, but I've heard many times before it's best to give people roses while they're living and so this is exactly what I am trying to do. I want to show those who matter to me that they do. For the friends/family without Facebook I plan on sending them the post somehow so they can see it.  Sadly, I can't do that for my first person (who is getting today's post) because it is the librarian who was at my high school that I lost contact with after she got a new job. Without her, I wouldn't be where I am today. I hope somehow I can at least find a way to email her my thank you.  It's gonna be funny the next 50 days having basically two types of daily posts on different websites. Obviously I have a theme going on.  How many people do you think you can count up to who have truly helped you in getting to where you are today?  Can you recall the last time you showed your appreciation for somebody?  What is something you could write passionately about?  How sick am I gonna get from eating almost an entire bag of chocolate covered pretzels in one sitting?

956,"I can't believe it. After more than 20 long, grueling years, this is finally going to be the end. I have decided once and for all to end it thanks to today's event which acted as the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. Long story short, a girl I've been speaking for many months now, whom I like and who likes me, a lot, has spent that last four months trying as hard as she can to avoid seeing me and talking to me so that she can get over her feelings for me. Whenever I ask her why she can't just let me take her out, she'd always have a reason why a relationship is not the right step for her and that based on her past relationships, we would focus to much on each other and begin doing bad in school. Because of this, despite the fact that I live one street away, she refuses to see me. It's been 4 months. We haven't had a decent conversation in 1 and a half.   After all this time, she met another man at the bar, one of her drinking buddies, whom she is falling for and is over me.... which is what she wanted from the beginning. She didn't want those feelings for me to be there. I don't know why. Why am I poisonous? She has no problem seeing this other guy almost every day and violating almost every reason she had for not wanting to see me. I am a fool. I am a fucking fool. On top of that, the emotional abuse and trauma as a child, the family ostracization from childhood to adolescence, my grades spiraling out of control at that time, my brother passing away, my friendships being facades that were manipulated only to use me, my relationships that were only to toy around with me.  I've decided a long time ago that I wasn't meant for happiness in this world, but I think now, I realize that maybe its not just that I wasn't meant for happiness in this world, maybe I myself wasn't meant for this world.  I don't want to die, I just want to not exist anymore. I wish I can one day just be walking down the street and have a car just come and hit me. I can't think of anything more beautiful.  Anyway, I am still working out the details, but I do know that I want to go on my own terms. The day before my birthday in July so I do have a little bit of time to get things ready.

958,An honest review of the Purple Pillow I tried posting on their website but it was removed so here‚Äôs my honest opinion. I received this pillow 3 weeks after my birthday because apparently it takes 3 weeks to package and ship it. So after 1 month here you go.   Pros: Helps me sleep.  Breathable mesh causes air to gently blow on you when you move.  Extremely comfortable.   Cons: Has a funny plastic smell.  Weighs about 10 lbs.  Tends to get hot in the center even with the breath ability.  Is very flat so I have to stack it on another pillow.  Is 100$ but should be about half that.    Overall I‚Äôd give it a 3.5 pillows out of 5. Will this be the perfect pillow for you? Probably not. Would I rather just buy one of the 5$ puffy ones from target every 6 months? Yes probably.

981,"A bit sad Hi everyone, I'm sorry I'm posting this here, but I really don't have anyone to talk about this.  I'm friends with a lot of people in the military, and of course I know these people get transferred a lot.  I'm out of the country for a couple of months and I was hoping to see my whole group of friends reunited.   Turns out my first friend from that group (also the guy I fancy) it's being transferred way before time and someone broke the news to me just yesterday. Also another friend with his wife (whom is a good friend as well) might get transferred before time too.  They are very special people in my life and makes me a bit blue to see them go like this.  Edit; I just realised one of those friends had a minor accident on a plane on Monday (he's Air Force) and the next day on our whatsapp group he said: ""I love you all very much"".  I just realised that and it hit me like a bucket of very cold water  Thanks for reading and I hope everyone has a nice day, and sorry for the rant.  Xx. ",0,set2

The hail stops and turns into snow so I just go back to chilling on the couch when I see this kid start walking up my driveway ten minutes later.   My dog is barking at the front door and I contemplated not answering the door but I did anyways. The kid asks me if I have a phone charger so I grab one and let him in so he can figure out what house his girlfriend lives in.   I try to make small talk with him but I really have no idea how to talk to young people so it's super awkward. I also can't stop thinking about those black eyed children myths and wonder if I'm about to get murdered by a seventh grader.   I guess eventually he gets his girlfriends address, says thanks for the charger, and peaces out.

Im done trying.  I just need to tell that person it isnt their fault, but i cant access hangouts because i left my phone, knowing they would use it to track me.

A lot of you are so helpful and I'm grateful but there are also a lot among you who comment nonsensical, irrelevant and frankly melodramatic comments.

Deep breaths! Come on!""  ""Take a night's rest and you will see the light, I promise.""  Stuff like that. It's usually about breathing or living, anyway. Usually in the form of a saying or figure of speech. Like suicidal people would suddenly just forget to breathe? Or suddenly our heart just stops and all we can say is: ""Oh well, guess I forgot how to keep the ol' popper ticking. People did remind me to keep living, after all. Silly me!""   As I said, these comments probably came from a very good place, I just want to reinforce the fact that the stories of suicidal people are not emotional attractions for people to ride. We just want help, validation and support. We're not here for reminders that someone out there will love us, or reminders to breathe.    Maybe it's just me, perhaps I've gotten more bitter after years of feeling this way. I personally just don't find comments like that helpful. To me it makes you look like you're there to leech off of other people's misery so you can feel better about yourself, while still submitting low-effort ""helpful"" comments so you can make yourself believe that you did something good. If anything it makes me want to do it more.  To those that can't relate to this, those that know they genuinely care and always make sure their comments are heartfelt and lengthy. You are a great person and this is definitely not directed at you.

At the beginning I didn't really have a purpose of posting other than just archiving what I thought were my cool matches so I didn't lose them. Eventually I started have a pretty big collection of content but still no one was really watching and I don't particularly blame them... It was a random dude playing a game at a pretty mediocre level.  The latest version of the game came out a little more than two years ago and I have been posting matches as I leveled up. In all it's nerdy glory, I have reached Diamond rank in SFV. Not an incredible feat for thousands of players but at the same time, it means I am in the top 2% of players in the world. And my matches kinda chronicle that journey.  The higher the rank has netted more views and on top of that I have been discovering tech within the game and sharing when I could. Lastly I have captured games beating some of the best people in the world.  So here I am, I am probably playing Street Fighter the best I ever have in my life *(after 30 years of playing)* and my channel has the most viewers it ever has.

Since I suffer with insomnia, I thought why not make use of my time.   I would make a post online and wait. On average each night I would read to about 3-5 people until they fell asleep. I was able to do more if I had enough time that night. On average, it took about 15 minutes or less for people to fall asleep. I enjoyed reading and these people and they enjoyed being read too, needless to say it was a win win.   As I got older, I decided to diversify and start sending goodnight messages to those who wanted one (voice messages). This proved to be quite popular, it wasn't until a few months later that I realised how much some people really appreciated a 30 second message wishing them goodnight.   After doing this for several months I began to get ""regulars"" I didn't mind and we managed to find a schedule that suited nearly everyone. I enjoyed reading to these people, even though I did receive a lot of perverted messages based on my voice. That's what the block feature was there for! :) My enjoyment went down hill after some began to become rather obsessive/a tad possessive. Any who, I digress...  That was my random past time.

1031,"Do any of you guys know about the ""quesadilla con o sin queso"" thing that we have in Mexico? For starters, we have this thing in the *CDMX* and the *Estado de M√©xico* that usually bugs other mexicans. The thing is, in most restaurants and street food stands in M√©xico, we have a very popular and characteristic dish called a *quesadilla*. The thing is, in the *CDMX* and the *Estado*, we serve them with a lot of different fillings, such as *chorizo*, *chicharr√≥n prensado*, chicken, etc., whereas in most of Mexico *quesadillas* are *always* filled ***with*** cheese and **very** occasionally with something else. That's the thing that bugs most outsiders and some *capitalinos*; basically, the debate divides in ""las quesadillas a huevo llevan queso"" (that is, ""if it doesn't have cheese, it ***absolutely cannot***  be a *quesadilla*) and ""las quesadillas no siempre llevan queso"" (""it doesn't ***necessarily*** needs cheese to be a quesadilla"").  I'm using that much emphasis since the divide is kinda strong and both sides are very stubborn to each other.  I'm just really curious as to know how much do people in the USA (insert generic ""America is a continent"" comment here) and other english-speaking countries know about our culture. This isn't as much of an important part to it; it's more of a perk than an actual, serious debate, but I kinda wanted to know if you've heard of it. And if you had, what side are you on and why?

1032,"So yeah, fuck this shit Boy did my life go exactly opposite of how I imagined it.  I don't even know how to phrase it correctly lol.  I turned gay, I don't know how, but it did. I went from straight to gay. Not born.  I remember having my first sexual fantasy at 7/8 years old about a girl in my class. I remember being fascinated by breasts when they were shown on movies (like Titanic, Friday the 13 (2009),etc...), or even when the nudity was implied (Charlie's Angels). I was so fascinated with this I remember drawing girls either nude or in sexy outfits. I was looking foward to grow up cause I really wanted to have sex. I thought about holding and licking breasts so much as a kid. (There are way more memories than just this, but just to give an idea)  Now I'm not sure if those memories are even real. For the past 3 years I've been reliving those memories as a way to prove myself that I'm not gay, because I really don't want to be. It's not that I live in a hostile environment, that my parents are homophobic, that my friends won't accept me, or that my faith condemns it. No, the exact opposite: my parents are open minded, my friends are too (and some of them are gay), and I'm an atheist. It just isn't who I want to be. I don't care about not having a traditional family, I care about who I have sex with, who I cuddle during a movie. I would rather have everyone think I'm gay and be straight.Even if being gay was the norm, I would choose to be straight (straight guy). I would rather be a lesbian, I just need to be with women. Nowadays, the fantasy about women come and go, but for the past 3 months I haven't been able to get an erection by thinking or looking at women. And if I think about it hard enough I can get an erection about a man. I keep testing myself with porn, and I've got precum by watching gay porn.  I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for the past 3 years, and their intensity comes and goes. But lately, man they are strong.  I just feel hopeless, I keep rewatching the movies that remind me of my sexual awakening, how much I wanted to be with a woman, and cry, just cry my lungs out.

We had a barbecue, and when I went to get something to eat, the same guy gave me some skewed cheese, even though he knew the skewer was burning, he told me to pick it up. And I felt nervous, and my mom was yelling at me about it. When I picked it up, my finger burnt so bad, I practically hurled the skewer across the room. It left a pretty nasty burn on my finger. When I was going upstairs to be alone for a bit, I picked up an umbrella because it was¬†reeeeal¬†rainy and at that same moment the wind knocked a Bluetooth speaker down from a wood beam close to where I was. And, jokingly, one of my relatives said it was me and people believed it. Skip forward a few hours, as I went to take a bath, I overheard my name and started paying attention to people downstairs. My mom saw me looking at them and thought I was staring at her. Then she started staring back and got mad at me again. As I was heading to the bathroom, I overheard my mom saying ""don't mind him, he's retarded."" And I don't know why, but that really struck me. Then I spent like a literal hour under the shower, just looking at my steamy reflection on a giant mirror they had inside the shower box. After I was done, a really annoying kid arrived and started to piss me off. I was holding me back not to throw him inside the pool. He's here right now by the way, and every 5 minutes he comes to knock on my door. What bothers me isn't even the fact that he's knocking, it's the fact that he just wants to play with my stuff. He doesn't want me. I'm just a walking laughing stock for everyone, it seems. That's how I feel at least. Everything I do is funny to someone in some degree. I feel like an animal in a zoo. Like a dog, just entertainment on legs. At night, when I wanted to just lay down on the couch, I asked my mom's boyfriend ""excuse me"" so he could let me through. But I accidentally bumped into him and he thought I was just pushing him aside. We got into a really heated argument. You could touch the tension in the air. then I went to sleep and today morning was just... Awkward. Packing was awkward. Having breakfast was awkward. Everything was awkward. The trip home, that kid kept bugging me to play with my PSP, even though he was playing on his own phone. Now I got home, and I just stood sat on my bed, holding back not to kill myself.  I'm sorry if I sounded bratty or played the victim card, I just...¬†Sigh¬†I don't know anymore...  ",1,set2

1073,"Don't want to live anymore Hello.  This is my first time talking about this to anyone.    My parents describe me as serious during my infanthood which has persisted with me through the years (age: 18-24).  During my childhood I had brief instances of not belonging with my family.  They were fleeting, but occurred regularly.  One day I told my father when this feeling came on, but he quickly and somewhat harshly quelled me.  In addition to these feelings I found myself never being able to be genuinely happy.  During birthday parties, christmas, etc, I always had to force a smile to please others.  Growing up I had few friends and always found myself leeching off my younger brother for friends causing him to get upset with me on numerous occasions.  I never had a birthday party where I had friends over.  High school and my teen years were more or less the same, but I had a small friend group.  This lack of genuine happiness has constantly been there overshadowing my entire life.  I have never been suicidal before only sad.  Now I am suicidal, and I think about it daily.  If I were to do go through with it I would OD on an opiate.  At this point I am open to ideas and am willing to try almost anything.  Sorry that the writing is sporadic, and the transitions are non-existent.  Feel free to ask me questions so I can further clarify my circumstances.    ",1,set2

As for myself my studies are going pretty well so far. I have submitted 2 assignments so far (and on time!). For those interested I am majoring in psychology, and this trimester I am taking social psychology and cognitive psychology. Two fantastic choices I think. Social psychology in a nutshell is about understanding why we behave as we do in front of other people, it is about group dynamics, stereotyping, close and intimate relationships. Cognitive psychology is about things like object perception, memory; how we acquire, store and retrieve information. And I am also doing criminology as an elective, it has been great so far!

1083,"Waiting for temporary restraining order, scared in my own home. So last Sunday, the 25th of March, I [21 F] was at my local police station in NJ for three hours to get a temporary restraining order from my ex [24 M] who lives in Staten Island, NY. I was told he would be served within a couple of days and it‚Äôs been over a week now. He is still messaging me via social media on a fake account he created because I blocked all the other ones and he still sends random texts now and then in addition to the online messages. He made over 10 fake numbers off of texting apps to text and call me non stop and it‚Äôs still going on to this day. Yes, he has threatened my life and I have evidence of it BUT still no word if he has gotten served or not. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can handle feeling scared in my own home and just dealing with this in general. It‚Äôs really driving me insane.   I went to court this past Thursday for the first time about this matter and met a lady from the Safe and Sound organization. She told me basically what I needed to do to get this rolling and that I need to get my order amended because there‚Äôs just not enough information on the order itself. After my name was called in the court room my case was put off to the next week, Thursday, April 5th, and the lady from Safe and Sound gave me some info about the organization and took me where I had to go to get my order amended. However, I couldn‚Äôt stay longer than I did that morning because it was such a last minute thing and I had other things I was supposed to do. So, I am going back to the courthouse today (Tuesday, April 3rd) and try to amend my order.   I called my local NJ police station to see what‚Äôs going on with him being served and I was told to call the 800 number on the report. So I did that and the man who answered said that, that service was not available in NJ. I also called the Staten Island Police station and they told me that my local station should have that info BUT my local station didn‚Äôt help me the first time I called.

I thought the idea of the movie was stupid when the first one came out and I had no interest in watching it. A month or so after The Second One (the actual title of the movie) came out I decided I might as well watch this garbage. I absolutely loved them with how bad they were and I was so disappointed that I didn't watch the first movie when it originally came out because I could've had the chance to be in The Second One as an extra since it was filmed in NYC. The third movie came out on my birthday the year it was released and that was the best birthday present I had. The fourth one had absolutely no plotline and was just filled with cameos that went over my head. I went to a bar with my best friend for the fifth one because we heard there was going to be a viewing party of it but we ended up missing the first half hour and the viewing party was just us and the bar tender; I have to rewatch that one before August.  I am so hyped though for the sixth movie cause it's gonna have time travel and who knows what else (I'm not reading anything about it so I can be pleasantly surprised when it comes out).  I know Sharknado is ripped apart by everyone, and I can totally understand it; but that doesn't take away from my enjoyment watching these movies. I hope I can find a legit viewing party in the city for it when it comes out (and if not I will throw one myself).  What's something that you were sad to see come to an end?  Ever make yourself do something just because you wanted to see what the hype was about?  What weapon would you use to fight against sharks in a tornado?

1114,"Cracking knuckles (#98) ^^^I ^^^am ^^^in ^^^love ^^^with ^^^the ^^^current ^^^drama ^^^going ^^^on ^^^with ^^^this ^^^sub ^^^about ^^^the ^^^escaped ^^^470 ^^^pound ^^^gorilla ^^^and ^^^the ^^^poacher ^^^who ^^^lost ^^^his ^^^hat  When I was in 5th grade I was bored at some point in one of my classes. At that time I wanted to be a *badass cool kid* but I was far from it. On this particular day I decided to teach myself how to crack my knuckles. I figured it out pretty easy and haven't stopped since. I actually crack my knuckles three different ways now on my hands. The first is by balling up one hand into a fist and pushing against them with the other hand. The second is by doing the same thing but instead of having my hands in a fist, my finger tips are against the bottom of my hand [like so](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/14/Crack-Your-Knuckles-Step-6-preview.jpg/550px-Crack-Your-Knuckles-Step-6-preview.jpg). The third is by grabbing each finger individually and pressing against it sideways. With my thumbs I'll just crack them by pressing down on them with my other fingers and then wiggling the top part while squeezing against my other fingers until the other knuckle cracks.  My hands aren't the only thing I crack. I can also crack my neck by pushing against my chin in both directions. My left shoulder by lifting up my left arm above my head and basically punching the air to the right. Sometimes my right shoulder by squeezing it in towards me. The left side of my jaw by opening my mouth and moving it in to the left. The back of my knees (repeatedly no less) by bending and straightening them. My back by twisting my body. My ankles by rolling them around. And my toes by squeezing them. Sometimes I can get my hip to crack my standing a certain way. Occasionally some other body part will crack accidentally and I'm just like ""woah!""  I've looked into it, and this does not cause joint pain or arthritis.  When I get nervous I end up cracking the knuckles in my hands a lot more than usual. Same thing when I am bored.  Sometimes when I go upstairs the back of my knees will crack every step of the way. This might be a problem. It also happens when I do box jumps.   I know some people who are absolutely disgusted/agitated by the sound of people cracking their knuckles and if I remember someone doesn't like it I try to be conscience of not doing it near them (at least audibly because many times I can't help it).  Sometimes my mom calls me a bitch (jokenly) when I crack my neck or back and she can't.  Can you tolerate when people crack their knuckles?  Do you crack your own knuckles or any part of your body?  What are your nervous ticks?

1116,"Flying simulators (#95) Today my best friend and I went to the Intrepid Air and Space museum. I hadn't been there since I was still in single digits and she had never been. It was really cool walking around learning about military history and the different uses of all the vessels that the museum has. One of the features at the museum was a flight simulator where you had shoot down enemy planes. We bought tickets for that but waited until the end of the day to go to it (we had a really big lunch and didn't want to upset our stomachs, plus it was at the end of the museum).   After walking around for 3.5-4 hours we finally went over to the flight simulator and she got to see what it entailed: a lot of flipping and turning and all craziness. From the few times we've been to amusement parks together we've realized that her stomach can get unsettled on rides pretty easily. The entire time we were on line we were planning our route to the bathroom if she felt she needed to throw up. When we got on the ride the instructors told us that only one person can fly at a time and we can switch the pilot by pressing a button and end the ride with a different button. My best friend put me in charge of flying. I wanted to do all the crazy flips and turns and stuff, but I also didn't want to make her sick. I did some tricks and she was yelling at me, but it was all in fun. At some point I honestly had no idea how to turn us around to face the way we needed to go so I said ""You drive"" and I slammed the switch pilot button. Her controls were facing a way that we immediately flipped upside down and she quickly hit the button again and told me to fix us.   After all three minutes were up we got off the simulator without actually shooting down a single enemy plane. My friend actually felt fine and we were able to go through the last little bit of the museum with no problems.  I had done a flight simulator once before at the Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington DC. I was with a different friend and again I was in the pilot's seat. I had absolutely no idea how to orient ourselves properly and so we spent a majority of the ride upside down with her yelling at me the whole time. It was fun.  Have you ever been in a flight simulator before?  How do you feel when you fly on planes?  Ever get sick after going on a ride? (Roller coaster, ferris wheel, whatever)  Do you have any interesting in learning about military history?  Are you any good at video games that involve shooting?

1118,"welp. I discovered last week that I got into a top-choice college. It was amazing! I'd gone on a string of rejections for a while, and was really beginning to doubt myself, but to see myself get into THIS particular school... it was a euphoric feeling, to say the least.  But then I got the financial aid package.  I've pretty much accepted that I won't be attending this school. But it's a gut-punch. All of this work, and even more continual work to raise the funds, and it still won't be enough. I'll admit, I spent three days straight crying over this. It's all been for nothing. I've asked anyone if there's any sort of way short of a miracle to raise the money I need, but there really isn't. It's as if everything I've been doing these past few years of my life were just four years that I was pursuing the wrong thing.  It's just... I know this is extreme, but I've just lost a will to live. I HAVE grappled with suicidal ideation before, but never has it felt this intense before. They come and go in waves, so to speak, and usually in very stressful situations for me. I've always been able to work through it. I just get the feeling this is going to be a longer wave than usual.  Special thanks for reading my vent. I do believe I will be able to get through this as well, but at the same time I wish I'd just been rejected altogether from the school rather than accepted and unable to afford it. I'd probably have been able to move on easier, considering that this was my final decision following a string of rejections.  ",1,set2

(I have unlimited minutes, otherwise these long conversations would not take place. I'm a broke student nurse.)   Calling each night is mandatory, after showering and brushing my teeth it's on the phone to my friend. I have to admit that after doing this for so long, I find it hard to sleep without talking to him. Strange right?!   Is it weird that we do this? Or is it more common than I'm aware of?   Also, I do apologise for my bad grammar and digressions during this post. ",0,set2

1153,"There's no light for hope What do I say? My life is the worst? It's not. I'm a mid 30s male and there's so much in this world to experience. At least that's what people tell me. I grew up in a very small town (less than 1000) where both my parents grew up as well. I was active in church, I played in pep band, and was the resident geek as I somehow had a brain to grasp computers. After high school I tried college for the next 7 years. In and out to the point I finally got an associates degree. Big whoop. Doesn't do anything for me and haven't had a job in the tech field for over 8 years.  Eventually I was requainted with a girl from our hometown at some mutual friends' wedding. 3 years later we married. That was over 4 years ago. I struggled with alcoholism until about 10 months ago when I just realized I didn't want that for our future life together and simply stopped. It was great! It finally seemed life was going to be what we wanted it to be...  Her brother had gotten me a great job with lots of room for advancement. I was well liked and stood out among the workforce. I was well on my way to moving up. We lived in a big house with a couple roommates. Both we had known for a long time and we all got along great. The last I remember speaking about our future was mid to end of November. How we were going to work on having children this coming year, find a place of our own, and even buy a 2nd car. 2018 was looking to be a wonderful year. Then came the week before Christmas.  The Sunday before Christmas, while she rode the bus to work, she text me saying didn't want to be married anymore. The next few months cut my very core out. She started staying with a trans male coworker (intimately as well), got on dating sites, and even tried to fuck a coworker in the basement below our bedroom one night before I told him he needed to leave.  Emotionally distraught, my performance at work began to suffer. The owners, supervisors, and coworkers alike all tried to help the best they could, but in the end, as gracious as they were, I had to be let go. The lease was soon up on the house and everyone had moved out. The roommates helped me the best they could, but I soon had to move in with a cousin a couple hrs away.  In the weeks that followed, a severe, dibilitating pain I had experienced once before came back and hasn't gone away for weeks. I've had multiple tests and am waiting on the results of the last round. And just the other day I was informed my wife had taken me off her insurance. So, here I sit: pain that barely let's me get about most days, completely broke, and no source of income. My wife is having a blast living the single life while I sit here being a burden on the people around me.  Why go on? I'm already in my 30s with no love interest. I'm already a few years older than my dad was when I was born. I seriously doubt children are in my future now. I'm not drinking anymore. Why is all this happening? Just when I thought life was beginning to take off, it completely and utterly came crashing down around me. This would all make sense if I was still actively drinking and being a shit head.  My world view is so bitter now. I was that overly optimistic guy you know who can for some weird reason always see the bright side of any situation. Not anymore. I see married couples and just think how long till you guys quit each other? Jr/Sr high students all looking at a bright future I just want to grab and say what are you so happy for? Life is shitty no matter what you do! I don't even have the strength to be selfish with my things and have simply been giving away whatever I can. Not even selling them. Just giving away precious things. Heirlooms I wanted to give my children someday. If it weren't for the instinctual motivation that being ""hangry"" gives us, I would simply stop eating. I just want to be done. My dreams have died turning my heart cold and my outlook on life bleak.  So that's my life now: waiting for the end of this cold tunnel with no light for hope.  P.S. She never did give me a reason why she didn't want to be married anymore. ",1,set2

1194,"Currently sitting in a hotel near Beachy Head, one of the world's most famous suicide spots. I'm hoping to jump tomorrow. I spent the day walking around the cliffs. I've never been here before but settled on this place because it has such a high success rate. I promised myself that if I were to go through with this I had to make sure I succeeded the first time and didn't just end up with some brain or internal organ injury. My only regret is that some poor team will have to clean up my remains, but I'd rather a team of experienced people do that than being discovered by someone I know.  I've wanted to commit suicide for a while now, but even still, before I arrived here I was worried that I'd see it and be too scared to do it outside of my own home, but it is very peaceful here. It's almost a surreal place, it's perfect. I was also worried about encountering the volunteers who try to stop people from jumping, but I didn't see any on my walk today, though that may have been due to the weather.   I've posted on here before under a couple of usernames and have had some nice messages of support, so I thought it was fitting to write a little goodbye to the few people who cared towards the end, you guys do great work for many people. If any of you happen to live in Eastbourne and hear about a young man jumping in the next few days, just know that I'm finally at peace, I'm sound of mind and it's what I wanted. ",1,set2

I've heard about the questions before but, being the ever-skeptical person I am, found myself rolling my eyes when I heard the concept.

If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know? 14. Is there something that you‚Äôve dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven‚Äôt you done it? 15. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life? 16. What do you value most in a friendship? 17. What is your most treasured memory? 18.

Make three true ‚Äúwe‚Äù statements each. For instance, ‚ÄúWe are both in this room feeling ... ‚Äú 26. Complete this sentence: ‚ÄúI wish I had someone with whom I could share ... ‚Äú 27.

A Little backstory:  I'm 30, I transitioned out of the shop and field so to speak roughly 14 months ago.  I ran my own business throughout my 20's, but missing out on chunks of my daughters early years, and the advent of another child on the way, necessitated change.   I found a good business to work for, where I could apply what I have learned over the first half of my working life so far.  somehow I found myself quickly climbing the ranks, and now I spend 3 to 4 days a week in the bay area of CA, alone.  I actually enjoy it, to a degree, I'm not anti-social, but I'm very task oriented so I tend to fixate on my daily objectives. I find myself back in the hotel room around 5 or 6 PM.  Some days just checking out and watching a movie or picking up a book will suffice, however, other days I get this nagging feeling that I'm wasting valuable time, I could be doing something more entertaining/fulfilling/educational etc.   I'm interested in hearing from people with similar situations, and what they've found to help kill the time, or expand on themselves. however, I'm still interested in hearing good book recommendations or good movies...hell, even good places to eat if anyone happens to have area specific recommendations after a little conversation.   thanks in advance, everyone!

I used to have a tight knit group of friends at my old community college. We would spend every day together and I remember looking forward to every day because of it. We just enjoyed being around each other and it made every day fun.  Last year I graduated. I transferred to a university in the same town, but I had one friend move to a different state. Another friend is moving to another state in a week, and after this quarter my closest friend will be most likely moving out of state as well. I don't get to see them very often as it is, and I miss these guys. We truly care about each other. I miss having that close connection.  Throughout the year I've realized that the friends i've made at my university is just no substitute for that. Since we all live in the same dorm there ends up being a lot of drama. Sure, I had drama in my last friend group, but it wasn't anything as common or petty as this. It's less of a ""I-want-to-hang-out-with-these-people"" type thing and more like a ""I-live-with-these-people-so-I-better-get-along-with-them"" thing. There's so much talk that I feel like if I make one wrong move or say something weird they're going to find me annoying and not want to talk to me. I understand that this in itself it incredibly petty and I realize that these people just make me self-conscious.  It's spring break now, and I'm thinking I'm just going to have to distance myself from all of my friends this quarter. We'll all be moving out soon anyways, so I might as well get used to spending less time with them. I was hoping to find a roommate for next year, but it might just be best that I go out on my own.

My answer always prompts the follow-up: ""No, where are you *from*?"" To which I often respond: ""Do you mean: what's my background? Or what's my cultural heritage?""  I do feel pretty cheeky giving such responses, but I wonder how other people feel about this sort of question - it's always been a nit-pick of mine in any conversation starter.

The dream itself was kinda weird. It was about a girl I'm really good friends with (that I just so happen to have a crush on and is amazing) but who has a boyfriend right now. I guess the premise of the dream was that she broke up or just didn't have a boyfriend at the time. So I was all like ""great, time to make some moves"". But no, somewhere in the dream she told me (I really don't remember specifics, it's really fuzzy now) that she was leaving the area or something and that either we could no longer be friends (she didn't put it that way, just that either the distance or her personal choicr meant we couldn't keep in touch or that she needed to get away for a while) or she got a new boyfriend.   Either way, it felt like we broke up, and now I'm feeling like we actually did irl. I've been awake lying in bed for over an hour pondering the dream, but I should have gotten up 15 minutes ago to get ready for the day. Now I'm low-key depressed about it.

1306,"have you ever been in the state where you‚Äôre aware of your surroundings but also asleep? Today, during my state test, I was really sleepy and fell asleep multiple times. I was constantly doing the head bobble thing where you lean forward but then jolt back. So once I was done with my test, I took a nap because as still had two hours left.   During my nap, I was aware of my surroundings. I couldn‚Äôt really hear anyone because it was kind of like speaking into blankets, muffled sort of. I was aware I was asleep though and everything was black. The entire time, I was dreaming/ having nightmares. Every time I had a dream I wanted to end, I could end it but something new would appear. I remember having rapid fire dreams, one after another. I wish I was allowed to write on paper while others were taking the test but the dreams I could remember scared the living hell out of me.   The first one I can recall isn‚Äôt that scary, but I was having a conversation with a friend I really want to get to know better. He‚Äôs pretty funny and chill and in this dream we were having a conversation. I knew I was dreaming, but the conversation felt so real as if I were actually talking to him. I woke myself up by almost talking out loud and responding to him. I jolted and got up because I was about to respond to him. I can‚Äôt remember what we were taking about though.   Then these were the dreams that scared the hell out of me. It started off with my friend, well call her Gia. You know when your eyes cross and your vision duplicates and the opacity is kind of low do they overlap? I saw two of Gia in that way behind a black background. She was slowly morphing into different things, and it was all staticky and glitchy. It freaked me out, and as I mentioned, I could change my dream when I wanted to, so I did.  Then the same thing started happening to my friend, well call him, James. The same cross eyed vision thing happed, so I saw two of James. He was slowly morphing into different people, into a person that looked really familiar but I can‚Äôt recall who. But as James kept morphing I wanted to scream, I was on the verge of tears. Then I wanted it to end so I changed it. The transition between my nightmares were like a glitch staticky kind of transition.  This time it was me. I remember seeing demonic sounds. Which, sounds weird, like seeing sound, but that‚Äôs the only way I can describe it. Then eventually I kept morning into different things, but I kept changing at a rapid pace. So when Gia was morphing, it was really slow. Then when James was morphing, it got even faster. Then when it got to me, it was rapid, changing every two seconds. It ended with me looks like a cartoon sock puppet. Which sounds pretty funny, but after being in that sequence of dreams, it was horrifying. The idea of being not even human terrified me.  I ended up waking up in the verge of tears. I was so ready to just cry.   When the test ended, I got out my phone and immediately texted Gia and James about my dream. Gia then followed up with saying that morphing is one of her biggest fears, which scared me even more.   Have you ever experienced the in between state of being asleep and awake?

I am in my final semester of college and just the other day I handed in the final check paying the last of my college tuition. No longer can I cross the street without a care and mentally chant ""Pay my tuition"" to any of the cars that drive by me. It's kinda surreal.  One of the factors that went into choosing my college was the fact that it had fairly cheap tuition. The price to be a full time (in state) student adds up to just a little over $6000 a year. This is actually cheaper than the tuition for the private high school I went to. I didn't dorm because the school is pretty close to home--it's only 11 miles away but due to the fact that it's in Manhattan and I live in an outer borough it takes about 1.5hrs to get there via public transportation. I also never really needed to get actual textbooks for a majority of my classes. All of this added up to me not having to pay crazy money for school. On top of it, I got a couple of scholarships. I'm so glad I have no student loans or debt to pay off after graduation.  I just never understood how people could drive themselves into debt for going to a private college or dorming when they didn't need to. While there are times I wonder what life would be like if I had gone away for college, I don't regret my decision. I have an upperhand than most college graduates financially and I'm really happy about that.  One weird thing though, I have a hold on my account right now from financial aid even though I never receive that. My coach actually emailed me about it earlier today and said I should go to bursars to fix it so I can graduate. Hopefully it's just an error in the system (which seems to happen often) but I'll find out tomorrow.  Do you have any loans/debt you're currently trying to pay off?

I want to get married in the next couple years so I want to start saving, I also need an emergency fund. I've already decided what I would get a masters in, Library Sciences. I'm looking into programs to start in the fall if I can't find a job.  I've got about 4 weeks to let the cookie crumble.. I get a job on campus and I'll go right to work. I dont and I'll get my real estate license to work full time with my parents while I get my masters degree online...

It‚Äôs a job where I need multiple background checks, physicals, and a mental evaluation. I was given a start date (April 23rd) and was originally told that I could put in my two week notice once I finish my physical and mental evaluation yesterday. After my physical I was told I‚Äôd have to wait another day for my blood work to be processed. So, I waited to hear from them today. I decided to put in my 2 week notice in tomorrow (April 5th), but then I was told that the job still isn‚Äôt 100% until 2 background checks were complete and that it should take about another week. I don‚Äôt of any reason I‚Äôd have an issue with the background check, but I don‚Äôt want to put in my notice until it‚Äôs a 100% sure thing.

I brushed it off and thought nothing of it, until it began to become an everyday occurrence. After a while this lady left. Another lady comes to the ward, then again with I'm pregnant every time she sees me. Three weeks later this lady ladie is discharged and another new lady comes and see says while I'm feeding her dinner that I am in fact pregnant. I was shocked! No word of a lie, the yogurt pudding nearly fell of the spoon with the body movement I made due to shock. I leaned in and asked this nice lady, are you talking about me? She replied, ""Yes, you. You're pregnant."" At this point, my face resembles the figure from the painting the scream. Not exactly what you want to see from the person feeding you.

When I got home I checked if I had the classic bun in the oven look (visibly pregnant) I concluded I didn't and even asked those around me if I did. They confirmed that I did not. This creeped me out even more.   This calling my pregnant happened every time the women saw me, even if they weren't under my care that shift. They were not on the ward at the time same time, did not come from the same home and did not meet previously in the hospital due to the time period. Needless to say I was baffled as all hell!

1370,"I started training to run 5 km and was confronted with the jiggliness of my body After lurking on /r/C25K (Couch To 5 Km) for a bit, I decided it was time to stop lurking and to start actively participating. I used to be in decent shape, back when I still played football (soccer) 5 times a week. In the last 4 years, however, I moved to a new city for university, I never signed up for a sports club or gym in that new city, and I have been struggling with a long-lasting depression. When you combine those things with not the healthiest of eating habits, a penchant for drinking when the depression is at its worst and not seeing the point of making changes to my lifestyle because of the depression, you get what I had become: lazy, overweight and horribly out of shape.  Lately, I have been doing better. I have been going to therapy, I stopped drinking altogether, I started to put more effort into my meals, I picked up some hobbies I had abandoned and I started to learn how to deal with my depression. Physical activity, however, was still lacking.  To change that, I joined the C25K program. Last week, I did my first trial run. I wanted to find out if the new shoes I bought were comfortable enough, figure out the right set-up for my gps-watch, and just get all of the niggly stuff out of the way so that I can make a good start with the program next week.   The first minute of running was very confrontational. I was able to finish it without too much difficulty, but I felt something I had not felt before. I jiggled. My belly jiggled. My upper legs jiggled. Even my lower back jiggled. I knew I was overweight, but I am not morbidly obese by any stretch of the imagination, and I had been telling myself that it really wasn't all that bad, but this run prooved that it is, indeed, pretty bad.  Four months ago, that realization would probably have made me quit right away, go back home, start spiralling into a depressive episode, go on a binge and feeling useless for the next week or so. But not this time. I took some rest to order my thoughts, accept what I felt, realised that I was working on what I felt at that exact moment and prepared myself for the next 60 seconds of running.   It feels good to have made this step. I know the program is going to be hard, but I feel like I can do it. Maybe not in the 9 weeks it's intended to be finished in, maybe not without setbacks, but I WILL finish it!  Have any of you made the step to get in better shape?

I'm happy with the results and experience, and when i stopped taking the pill and saw the weight stayed down, I recommended it to my closest friends. Then i told my wife ""I cant wait to tell so and so at work about it"" and she told me not to say anything about the pill, because its kind of embarrassing and like ""cheating"" so it may damage my reputation at work. She made a compelling argument for it so i agreed since nobody had asked me so far anyway.  When I began to visit my locations after my little ""transformation"" had proven permanent without the pills, at first they didnt say anything, but then they began to comment how they were all shocked and asked how I did it, specially the heavier set people obviously. I just thanked them for the compliments and said work has been so busy Ive been skipping meals almost daily, and drinking a lot of water instead of soda to avoid stomach aches. This was all true and they saw it for themselves, and casually tested me about never seeing me eat in the past, so they bought it, and said at first they didn't want to ask because they didn't want to be inappropriate, and then offered me food lol. But it feels wrong, there's at least 3 co-workers with big events coming up in the summer and they would benefit so much from this pill, but in reality we aren't friends, just aquaintances, and while I would be happy if they spread the word so others can try it and see if it works, I am indeed worried my name would piggy back on it each time it's brought up.",0,set2

1376,"I want to do/make something for my SO since he's been taking care of me during my surgery recovery Hi all, first time poster. I recently had a major back surgery, an artificial disc replacement. I am 21 and my SO is 22, and we have been together for 6 years. He has been taking such good care of me, helping me dress, get around, making sure I take my medicines on time, cooking for me, etc all with zero hesitation. I would do the same for him in a heartbeat but I have surgeries fairly often and I would like to do something special, since this is not the first recovery he has helped me through.  I could always buy him something, he loves video games like I do, and work tools as he is an electrician.

1379,"I'm gonna miss my friends when we all graduate A little backstory: I grew up in a poor family and I've been through more than one rough patch as a teenager. I got to pursue a higher education on grants, and I can say with full confidence that my time at college has been the best years of my life. I've learned so much, experienced new things, sharpened my skills, but best of all, I've made so many friends.  Yesterday my friends and I all got together to make General Tso's Stir Fry. I brought the ingredients, but everyone else helped in their own way. Some of them helped prepare the food, others brought utensils I was missing, and everyone kept a funny conversation going. The food turned out great, and we had so many ingredients left over that we decided to do it again today. I was writing about it in my journal after we finished cleaning up, and it made me realize just how much I'm going to miss them all once we're all done with school.  I've known them all since my second year, we moved into the same quad (cluster of rooms) together, and  I've been living with them for the past 3 years. I remember my roommate for two of those years would host tabletop RPGs for us like D&D, and they were even more fun than I ever could've imagined them. And anytime one of us was in a bind, we'd all be willing to jump up and help out. They're all like family to me now.  Some people say you don't know you're in the good old days until long after they're gone. But I'm over here tearing up because I know that I'm in the good old days, and I'm going to miss being here in college so much. Two of my friends are graduating this semester. The others still have at least a year to go, and I have one extra semester left.  So, has anyone else here ever been in the same boat? Made a tight-knit group of friends at college, then separated after graduation? What happened afterwards? How did you cope moving on?",0,set2

I love being overworked and underpaid, and abused by customers. /s  Today was more of the same all day long. I was supposed to get off work at 430, and ugh I was ready for it. I was so tired and in such a bad mood, I was counting down every minute. At around 4, this older lady came in and was looking at movies. I went over to her and did the usual ""can I help you find something"" spiel, and she started off with the usual ""no, just browsing"" thing. I said ok and told her if she needed anything, let me know. She ended up saying ok, but then started going on about how she was just looking for tv shows, she likes to collect dvds. I told her she was in the wrong aisle, and I walked her to the correct one. Then I was just being polite, and asked her what kind of shows she was looking for, and what is her favorite. She started to get really into the conversation and she was listing off all kinds of stuff, from new shows like Empire to old stuff as far back as like the original Twilight Zone. She was telling me how she doesn't have cable anymore since her husband died, she just has an antenna and loves watching all the re-runs of this or that, and also these new shows... she literally was telling me the days/times, channels, and number of episodes that come on each day for each show. Like for real, this lady is a hardcore lover of tv, especially old shows, but also several shows that surprised me when she named them. She was telling me how she sets her alarm to wake her up early specifically so she doesn't miss stuff too. Lol  Anyway, it just so happened, a few of the shows she named were ones I like too. I mentioned it, and she got really happy and we just started talking about those shows, and she said she was surprised about a few I knew too, saying she didn't think ""someone so young would even know about x, y, and z shows!"" Then she asked me if I had any suggestions, since it seems we have the same taste, so I got excited telling her about some things I had seen too. We seriously just stood there and ""compared notes"" on shows for 30 minutes. She then even went ahead and bought the complete series of one show I recommended, saying she trusted my judgement, and couldn't wait to watch it.   After that, she said she had really enjoyed talking to me, and that I had helped her a lot, then she thanked me, and she even used my name. It was nice, most people don't bother with my name or even look me in the eye, like sometimes I even wonder if people remember I'm a human being too. Anyway, she said she was going to come back soon, and she was going to find me again if she needed help, because I did a great job.  She was a complete stranger, but I really enjoyed talking to her, and she turned my mood completely around. I left work with a genuine smile on my face for once. ",0,set2

I've asked K and E about it several times and they said if they didn't want me here I would have been gone a long time ago... so it seems that they care.... main thing being is, I love all of them, I dont want to lose them but its looking like im going to. The way that I'm treated it hurts a lot... and I'm tired of losing people and I know K is too, so I dont want to leave them, also because I have a hard time finding people who will like me for me....

1417,Did anyone else have a hobby they enjoyed when you were younger but ended up dropping it for one reason or another and are trying to get back into it at the present? I'm 24 and in my last year of University studying History at the moment but despite my long post I love history still and hopefully if I make it through I'll start my PGCE.   Yet when I was younger during Secondary school I used to love drawing (though I wasn't great) yet what put me off pursing it further was when I asked the art teacher if based on my drawings I could pick the art course as a option and she flat out said my art wasn't good enough to do that.   After that I just gradually lost motivation to draw which in the end was on me as I could have kept trying to improve on my own but that hit my hard at the time.  Only this year I've been trying to get back into the swing of drawing again although it's pretty awful naturally after not drawing in years and I don't have as much time to work on it.  To be honest what brought this post on was the fact that I see lots of drawing posts on different sub reddits about how they have practised over the years when they were younger and are now great which is only natural but I don't often see many posts about people who started(or restarted) late with a hobby.   Doesn't have to be drawing but anyone else people trying to get back into a hobby they gave up when they were younger? How are you finding it?  Once gain apologies for this long post/ramble I don't usually post topics in general but was just kinda curious about anyone else trying to get back into old hobbies and how it's going :),0,set2

1419,"BookCon (#92) ^^^^I ^^^^spent ^^^^0% ^^^^of ^^^^my ^^^^spring ^^^^break ^^^^doing ^^^^any ^^^^of ^^^^the ^^^^school ^^^^work ^^^^I ^^^^needed ^^^^to. ^^^^Oh ^^^^I ^^^^cannot ^^^^wait ^^^^for ^^^^graduation  Last year on the first weekend of June I went to an event called [BookCon](http://www.thebookcon.com/). It was exactly what it sounds like, a convention for books, readers, and authors. I went solo because I like getting books by myself and I figured I'd be able to see more of what I wanted to without having to appeal to someone else's tastes. It was an all right experience. I got a good amount of books, a few were signed by the authors standing there and 1 or 2 were free. As far as I know, there really weren't any big names there unless you went to the meet and greet area but when I looked at that list I didn't see anybody who I had actually read before (and only a very small handful of names I recognized despite working in a library for four years) so I didn't bother waiting in line for any of those. There were also some panels going on and I went to two, one about sci-fi and incorporating politics into the fictional worlds; it wasn't as interesting to me as I thought it was gonna be. And the other was about how much of an impact the rise in the YA subgenre is having on teens and reading and it was actually more interesting than I thought it was gonna be. I gave the day overall maybe a 7 outta 10 because I was expecting more than what I got. But that didn't put me off from never going again.  I just remembered the other day the BookCon should be coming up in June so I looked online at the list of panels and oh my goodness I'm actually overwhelmed by all the panels that seem interesting. I'm planning on going to the Saturday of the convention because all the panels I am interested fall on that day; but the problem is there are a few that fall at the same or similar times as each other and I have to choose what I am most interested in attending.  To start off, from 9-11am I have to decide if I want to attend the Sci-fi and Fantasy writing workshop or the fiction writing workshop. Both of these cost extra (but are the same price) unlike the rest of the panels and I am interested in both. I am more used to writing plain fiction and I think I would have an easier time writing samples from the prompts given there; but I also really enjoy reading sci-fi/fantasy and yet I never write it because, well a bunch of reasons. That workshop claims it'll help focus on ""how to combine mind-bending world-building with a powerful narrative drive"" (quoted from the website). So I have to figure out which I want to attend more.  Then there is a panel called When Reality is Stranger Than Fiction that is from 10:30-11:15 which interrupts both the writing workshop session but it sounds kinda cool about how thriller/mystery writers are basically competing with grasping audiences when what is going on in the news is more compelling than made up events. I think though that if I have to miss this panel for the workshops I wont be too disappointed.   The next panel that sounds interesting is from 11-11:50am and that is called Horror! Thrills! Murder! Oh My! And it is about building suspense in writing across genres. It sounds pretty cool and I'm sure I could catch most of it after the writing workshop I attend.  A few other panels go on but none that really catch my eye again until around 12:45-1:30pm where a panel that discusses world building and how to make that interesting is going on (this time with one author who I recognize but never read before). I think learning from that would be cool.   The next panel that interests me is called Magic and Power at 3:45-4:45pm has a bunch of authors that I recognize but again haven't read and it's talking about fantasy books and how magic/power affects the struggles their characters face and stuff like that.  The last panel that I am interested in is called Into the Booth: A Glimpse Into Audiobooks at 4:45-5:30pm. I've never listened to an audiobook but my real dream job has always been to be an audio engineer in a recording studio so it'll be cool to sit in on that and just learn about how recordings for books are made.   There were a few other panels that looked like they might be interesting but not enough for me to really go. This gives me a jam packed day of learning cool things about books and writing and in the down time I'll maybe have between panel sessions I can walk around the showroom floor and get books, meet authors (and hopefully this time be a bit more talkative with them, cause I had no idea what to talk about with any of them last year), and just enjoy being around other book lovers. The Sunday panels I am sure are also interesting, but when I looked at them they didn't stand out as much as all the ones I mentioned here did.  I remember one of my coworkers thought the idea of BookCon was lame but he goes to ComicCon almost every year so who is the real nerd here? I'll be sure to tell him I'm going to BookCon again this year whenever we work together again.  Have you ever been to a convention for anything before?  Would learning about different elements of writing, like those mentioned in the panels I want to attend, interest you?  Are you someone who enjoys reading books? If so, what kind?

How bad they actually are, who are they, how did they became who they are, what was the angels' rebellion, and what does other religions/places believes about them?   Hope this is a right sub for it, since this is not a  religious debate for example, and not an AskReddit kind of question either. ",0,set2

1475,"My grandma turned 97 yesterday! NINETY-freakin-SEVEN!! I‚Äôm just so amazed but not at all surprised. She is one tough broad, who would blush at me saying that. Actually now, with the Alzheimer‚Äôs, she might just say back ‚ÄúDarn right!‚Äù She‚Äôs gotten sassy these last years. I had flowers sent and the picture of her with them that my cousin sent just made my heart swell. She is my last living grandparent, two of whom I never met.  I grew up in the same house she raised her 8 children in. While my parents were working full time and going to college/grad schools in the evenings, she took care of me. I spent summer days helping sort through donations at the church thrift store that she managed. I visited her at the town lingerie store when she worked there. I kept out of the way when she hosted Reading Group, her weekly book club with all her old lady friends who took turns hosting. Pepperidge Farm cookies, coffee and tiny glasses of wine. Book talk that segued into town gossip. I loved the scent of perfume that lingered after they‚Äôd all left, and the lipstick prints left on the glasses. I also loved the leftover cookies.   I‚Äôve been bracing myself for her passing, most seriously when she was hospitalized for the flu and pneumonia this winter. But those memories I have, and all I learned by watching her, won‚Äôt leave me, I just won‚Äôt let it.   97, way to go Nanny.

1476,"I'm 21, at the tail end of my 3rd year of college, and just switched majors this spring semester. As such, most of my classmates are 18-19 year old freshman. Which I don't have any issue with. My major change was a great decision and I'm really happy.   That being said, I've always felt young. Even though I'm 21, I don't *feel* 21. I still don't think I look like an adult. It's annoying. I think most of it is due to my height, being only 5'10. Anyway, I've gotten better at being okay with this feeling since I've hit the gym, noticed a good amount of gains, and my beard seems to get fuller and thicker every time I trim it.   But today, one of my project groups discovered I was 21. They were surprised, and rightfully so, assuming most of their classmates are 18-19 year old freshman. All of that was fine until one girl said, ""You don't look 21, no offense"" with a smile and relatively harmless giggle. But I still felt it.   Granted, it didn't sting as much as I expected it to, but I think I'm gonna remember it for awhile. If only because it's an example that shows that, maybe I do look younger than I want to look. And I've yet to have an experience that indicates I look mature, or something of that sort.   Kind of just here to vent. This happened a couple hours ago and I just keep thinking about it. Damn near texted my mom because I just NEEDED to tell someone about this. Anyway, thanks for reading! Don't mean for this post to be sad or anything, just, casually talking. :) ",0,set2

1479,"Have you ever tried to cut down on Reddit? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love Reddit. But, I‚Äôve had to step back from Reddit several times in the last couple years and evaluate whether it‚Äôs a beneficial or detractive force in my life.   I like the community aspect and I‚Äôve had some good discussions and a lot of good laughs. But at times my Reddit use has been compulsive in its frequency. I‚Äôve gotten in many heated arguments, fallen for many fake or misrepresented news stories, witnessed many Reddit controversies, and found quite a few toxic communities. As a somewhat neurotic individual, sometimes Reddit can get rather overwhelming for me.  I‚Äôve tried ditching Reddit several times, but I think I‚Äôve gotten a grip on it now. Lately I‚Äôve culled almost all news subreddits from my front page. I‚Äôve also started listening to more podcasts and generally reduced my redditing to what I (for now) perceive to be a healthy amount.

It made recall how I was back then, and I realized how much I have changed, maybe for the better.    Back then, I was an introverted kid, not so many great friends. Always at the computer. It's not like I was sad at that time, it's just who I were.    But then, I travelled to Mexico (from Denmark), studying abroad and getting new friends. It felt kind of like starting over. I knew no one other than my host family and a couple of classmates, but I decided I wouldn't let that discourage me. I was starting over after all, so I decided I wanted to try not being antisocial and introverted.
