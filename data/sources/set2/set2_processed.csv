I've never really connected to another person, because I don't know how. I have some people who ""care"" about me...my bosses, my co-workers, some students in a club I'm in, but they don't actually know me - they just see the facade I put on. They don't know how shitty my grades are, or how fucking lonely I am when I'm not at work or doing club things, etc. I'm a junior in college, so I don't feel like I can leave school (and forever regret wasting money without even getting a degree), and when I do graduate, it'll be with a shitty GPA with no direction in life whatsoever. From Nov-Feb, I was in possibly the worst depressive episode I've had, and I thought I finally was finally free in March, but even though I feel so much more functional and active these days, I still see no fucking point for living another day. Not when I've already screwed up at so many things. One of the ""friends"" I know from a club was talking about graduation earlier, and I remembered once again that I am technically a year behind in college, because I took a year off for mental health shit. She started college a year after me...and she's graduating at least a year before me. And it's not just her - everywhere I look, people are just so much better than me. I know I don't know the full story for anyone's life, and that everyone is going through their own struggles, but that makes it even worse...even with how shitty life can be sometimes, people are still achieving and advancing in their lives, and I'm here, a complete waste, sucking up oxygen and resources and an education...none of which I deserve  I know I can't kill myself now.

17,"The Hungarian language has more than 20 words for the same nasty thing... I love my language. It's beautiful and very descriptive.

Allow to me to explain, Ive been suicidal since I was 12 (I’m turning 22 at the end of this year). My childhood was absolute garbage, I was emotionally abused by both my parents up until my parents separation in high school. I was bullied relentlessly in elementary school, suffered severe depression in high school, an eating disorder in high school, have seen a handful of different therapists for many different reasons, (depression, gender dysphoria, eating disorders etc.) and have had 0 help from any of them.   No matter what I do, no matter what help I try to get, or how I try to change, I always feel the same. Like I want to die, and it’s gotten to the point where I can’t handle it anymore. I can hardly afford my rent, and am at risk of getting evicted every singe month, I’ve been on and off addicted to cocaine since I turned 18, never had a single relationship, dropped out of college, there is absolutely nothing good about my life whatsoever, and there never will be.  I know I have friends and family that will be sad, but I don’t think any of them understand how hard I’ve fought over the past ten years to stay alive because of them, I can’t do it, I physically can not do it.   So there, I have a date. April 16th 2018. I’ve started writing out some letters to people I know will want an explanation, and now I just need to figure out how. Last time I tried overdosing on pills and sadly I lived, I need to try and think of a more efficient way. I’m thinking I’ll either jump off the bridge I cross on my way to work, jump in front of a car, or slit my wrists, I don’t know, I don’t care about pain, I know death is peaceful and I know this is what I want.

But this year, they changed it to a year-long course on a wide variety of topics.    Now the class is called Health and Wellness, and while it still covers the old topics like sex ed, it also covers topics like healthy relationships, depression, and how to deal with stress. Today we began a unit on stress relief, and what are healthy ways to take care of stress in your life.

I know it’s not that easy and there is a lot more granularity to what I did, but this post was not meant to be an essay.   I know how hard it can be; With that said, if you ever feel this way and just want to chat, send me a PM! I’m happy to be there  Everyone needs a friend and if a random Reddit stranger can be that for a short period, I’m happy to be that.  If you are feeling really low where you feel you need more serious help / prevention then please call the suicide helpline, the Samaritans or see your Doctor / GP.",cc,1,0.164,0.064
77,"I was pleasantly surprised by Fortnite's Save the World (PvE) mode.... edit: I am* pleasantly surprised. ;-]   Thought I would post this here as I think the /r/FORTnITE subreddit would just be an echo chamber.  I played a bit of the Battle Royale mode that everyone's crazy about, but I could never see the fun in dying 99 times out of 100 (provided everyone is on the same skill level). Furthermore, there is just something so disappointing about building a fort, being killed a sniper that you couldn't even see far away, and having that fort vanish into the depths of instance hell.  On a whim, I decided to try out Save the World. I wasn't expecting such a cartoony shooter to have such fleshed out skill trees, crafting/building systems, and a wide array of diverse-looking characters. Unlike PvP, your forts actually matter for a longer amount of time, and in some cases, your base stays as it was when you built it in earlier quests.  A few hours in and I'm still in over my head trying to figure out keybinds and faster ways to build. This mode really is a hidden gem if you're into quick-paced base-building and horde-fighting. Once the whole game becomes free-to-play later this year, I can imagine a lot of players having fun in the PvE mode!  Anyone else try Save the World?",cc,1,0.101,0.096

I'm an amature musician and have a passion for pc gaming too. So it's fairly common to listen to music and play games at the same time that's basically a given tbh. However that's not my question. My question is does anyone else ever feel like there getting something I've nick names music triggered nostalgia. Ok hear me out I know it's a bit wierd and cheesy. I used to read a lot when I was younger and alot of the time I was reading I was listening to music usually one while album through to the end. Usually I'd listen to the album more than once while reading the same book. I also used to just listen to music doing basically everything too.  So sometimes Spotify will throw out one of the songs of those albums and it's like someone flicks a light switch on or opens a door into the plot of that book or the scene or activity I was doing at the time.   It's very vivid and I can sometimes even picture the lines of the book and what I depicted the scene as.  So in short I'm asking is there anyone that knows anymore about this or experiences this.

147,"So, I pulled a ""stunt"" at work this week... First off, sorry about the throwaway account. I really want to spill my guts to all of you great strangers of the internet, but don't want to leave so much identifiable info about me and my job on my main account. Also, sorry for the novel.  Anyway, I work as a drafter at an engineering firm, and am the low man on the totem pole for the electrical department. I've learned a lot over my time at the company & the engineers I work under have slowly been giving me more and more design responsibility, particularly for easier things like laying out lighting and plugs and stuff.  So we recently got this project. Its a complete gut and remodel of a pretty large existing building & they asked me to do the existing conditions field survey since everyone else in the department was busy with other projects & the building in question was going to be a simple place to survey  (an empty building with few interior walls). I've done many field surveys before (usually they give me the easier ones like this), so it wasn't anything new for me.  The project itself is a pretty intense & will require completely new electrical everything, including a whole new electrical service. Thankfully, while its a very large project with lots of electrical work, we've been doing quite a few projects lately that are very similar to this one (albeit much smaller). Because of the similar projects, I have direct experience with (or at least a reference to) a majority of the design components in this project, with 1 huge exception... The electrical distribution.  While the engineers trust me to do many of the simpler tasks for them, I've never really had the opportunity to touch the electrical distribution before. The engineers have been really awesome, though, and often explain their designs (and their thought processes regarding them) to me when they give me their markups. Because of these explanations, I feel like I at least know the basics of how everything works.  Earlier this week, we received the official go-ahead to start on this project, but due to disorganization in our department & everyone in the department being totally slammed with other projects, that go-ahead fell on deaf ears. I decided to kind-of use this as an opportunity to try to get out of my comfort zone a bit.  I send an email to the engineers in the department asking if I could take a stab at taking this project as my own & designing the whole thing. Of course, before I sent this email, I went ahead and did all of the preliminary design work (including the electrical distribution) on my own & without permission (figuring that its always better to beg forgiveness than ask permission).  The head honcho engineer came over shortly after I sent the email to discuss the email I sent. He was a bit skeptical, but overall fine with the idea, particularly after I mentioned that a majority of the project is quite similar to a few others & that I was the one who did the field survey. After he gave his blessing, I showed him what I had already come up with for the design. He sat down with me for a few hours and we went through what I had already come up with (particularly the electrical distribution).  During the discussion, I mentioned that I took some pretty big guesses on sizing based on what looked right from other projects. He went through the design with me & showed me the actual math associated with designing something like this. Surprisingly, my guesses turned out to be correct & he actually mentioned that the design looked like something that he would have come up with.  I know it sounds kind-of dumb, but I really feel like I accomplished something & I've never felt so excited about work before. Hell, the owner of the company actually came over to my desk today & said that he was proud of me (I have no idea how word of my stunt got around so quickly).  I mean, I know that its still super early in the game & I have plenty of opportunities to totally crash & burn on this project, but right now, I feel on top of the world. :)",cc,1,0.148,0.04

I was in a car accident (rear ended and not my fault) and ended up with a concussion and they almost had to remove my pancreas. I was in terrible physical pain. I already suffer from CRPS chronic pain in my arm. So it was miserable. But not only that but in the hospital for a week I was alone. Only the nurses. My mom and a friend came to visit me once but I wanted to just die there so bad. It would have been so much easier on my family. They would have a reason. They would have a stranger to blame. My suffering could have ended and I wanted to so bad. I still have a plan in place. I still know it’s going to happen but that could have been so much better. I just wish I was gone and I wish that my family could have had the health problem to grieve over instead of a suicide.  Sorry for the rant. I just want to pain to end. ,sw,0,0.091,0.263

I do fear this luck will not carry on, and sooner or later I’ll be in my demise. I really want to stop this from happening, I really do, but there’s so much on my plate right now, I don’t know how to handle it. My grades are dropping because I haven’t attended a single class since January. I take full responsibility for my grades dropping, but now I’m scared of the outcome. I know this is going to have major ramifications on my future. Being an international student, my family can’t support my fuck-ups at all. Sooner or later, I would be forced to travel back into a country I can’t even function in because I can’t speak their native language nor have I ever lived in a third world country before. This past week, I’ve been trying to keep myself sober, but when I am, I feel so fucking depressed. I really have no one to talk to. I spend so much of time crying at night wishing someone could comfort me and tell me everything is going to be fine, a physical person. I don’t know why I typed this, but I believed this belonged here. I really don’t want to die, but this fear of impending doom has been going on for more than a couple of months. I’m going to die as a failure and no one is going to notice me passing away in this country. I know I’m the maker of my own problems, but I feel like I’ve created so many that I will never be able to handle them. It’s exam season, and I’m probably going to be end up failing my coursework.

I have been in therapy for 10 years, and it's constantly like this. I wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing.  See, there is nothing in this world that brings me joy. I do not have any hobbies, and I do not have a job. I am going to be evicted if I do not find something before May, and while I have been applying, I also don't see the point.

My family thinks I am being a drama queen and won't ""play"" this game with me anymore. If I were to kill myself tonight, I wonder how long it would take the world to notice. I imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains.  I have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs, but I am not 100% certain that an overdose would be successful. I'm 80% sure since I have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol-- I don't drink, so I image I don't have a lot of tolerance-- it almost feels like I can pull it off.

156,"I think about killing myself every morning I wake up, and I'm constantly thinking about ways to do it through the day I'm 20 years old. Diagnosed schizoaffective along with major depressive disorder that either shows itself as mania or reclusiveness. I was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility for 9 days when I was 15 for suicide watch, as well as uncontrollable tactile and audio hallucinations. I'm a poly substance abuser, I will take anything that anyone gives me or that I can get my hands on no matter the situation, time or place. My binges along with the recent doubling of the dose of my antipsychotic have caused me to drop two of my classes because I've slept through alarms no matter what I've tried and still feel tired all day.   I took lsd the first time a month before my 19th birthday which was about two years ago. Since then, without exaggeration have dosed myself once for 9 days straight doubling the dose each day. I have taken acid over 150 times in the span of about a year in a half. The thing is it is the one substance that makes my depression and manic thought silenced and allows me to experience and love life like when it was better. It reminds me of being like 9 years old again.   I can't go a day without using drugs because it seems that that's the only control that I have over my emotions. Take stimulants to stay awake, benzos and booze to forget pain, opiates to feel happy. Everything I guess.   My schizoaffective disorder causes me to be baffled and confused about human normality and makes my emotions intense in every way. My ex cheated on me for months until I found out and the worst part is I have class with her twice a week because we signed up together before everything happened. The hardest part of my week is going into that class and trying not to cry and act civil even though I wish she'd just leave me alone.   I hate who I've become, I hate that I can barely seem to control my life and can hardly make it to work to pay the bills let alone take care of myself or make it to class without wanting to scream FUCK EVERYBODY IN HERE. I am so depersonalized that sometimes I have no sense of self. I would rather be admitted to the hospital forever sometimes because at least there I have a regime I can handle.   I don't self harm in the traditional way but try to get as trashed as possible with any substance, that's like my form of self harm. Like slamming a pint of vodka in one gulp and then lay comatose crying in my bed.   Anyway I hope that wasn't too much text.

Star garnets have inclusions that create a four- or six-pointed star when bright light shines on them, and to this day he still wistfully brings it up on occasion.  Star garnets aren't particularly expensive (although if I got a fancy metal for the setting that would be...); one big thing that's stopped me in the past from getting him a replacement is that I've never seen him wear jewelry beyond a watch and wedding ring. I have no idea what sort of style he'd like, or even what sort of male gemstone ring is good looking and not silly gangsta. I can't just ask him out of the blue what a ring he had 30 years ago looked like without it being suspicious, and he's a smart man.  So here's what I'm getting at: If you're a man or if you're in touch with men's fashion, could you look at some examples [like this](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1315&bih=813&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=5m7NWtXQE9eSjwS1l5boAQ&q=mens+ring+cabochon&oq=mens+ring+cabochon&gs_l=psy-ab.3...2119.2372.0.2475.4.4.0.0.0.0.134.249.0j2.2.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..4.0.0....0.NRuZfn8xWxU) and tell me what sort of gemstone ring setting *you* like the look of personally?

(keep in mind the train was still pretty far back so i kept asking myself if i should go through with it.) as the train got closer, i stood in the middle of the tracks and faced the train. i closed my eyes and whispered to myself 'this is it. i'm finally going to die'. the train horn was blaring constantly and i don't know if it was because he saw me standing there, or if he was just blowing the horn as the train neared the crossing. as it got even closer, the horn was blaring more constantly. at this point, i figured he saw me. the train was i would estimate about 10 seconds away from hitting me when i stepped off the tracks. i don't know why i did but something came over me at last second. the speed of the train actually knocked me down as it passed. my left hand ended up getting cut by a rusty nail that was in the road. it took about 4 minutes for the train to fully pass and i was just sitting on the ground crying the whole time. i kept hitting myself. after about 2 minutes, i got up and started walking home. i kept repeating the same question over and over again in my head.

I think I'm going to start messing with her. Maybe put her face as the background for my desktop? I thought about opening a Word doc and writing ""Hi Miss ______!""   Any ideas?  Edit: okay guys! I took a picture of a sheet cake and photoshopped the words “ Hi Miss ____!” on it. It’s on my desktop. Now we wait.",cc,1,0.048,0.07

222,"I Brainwash Myself to Believe I Don’t Have Depression (Long Post) I’m a high school student, grade 10 specifically. Mentally, I always believed I was a very healthy person. I lived in a good home and have many friends. Though starting second semester (Feb of this year) I started to go through episodes of “anxiety” and “depression”. This happened because of the amount of work I have to go through and several health problems (Sleep problems, type 1 diabetes). I often feel like a burden to everyone because of how much I make them go through because of my diminishing body and my lack of ability to be logically-mathematically intelligent.    Let me start with what happens at home and how it leads to everything. Like I said before, I live in an amazing home and a loving family. But the problems with them is a lot to do with their background. They’re immigrants and though I’m sure they know of depression, I believe they won’t take me seriously. When they watch the news and a report of a teen committing suicide comes up, they always tell me to talk to them if I ever had the thought. They always try to ask me how my life is going because they want to know I’m not going out of control. When I started to experience a spiral in my emotions, I wanted to approach them, but I always stopped myself. “They’re not from here, they don’t speak perfect English, they can’t comprehend what you’re going through, they’ll just tell you off.” Those are just some of the thoughts I have whenever I think about telling them. Stripping the connection between my episodes and letting them know what’s going on severely influenced me to keep everything under the rug from my family. This made me think this is only my situation and that they shouldn’t know or else I’ll just be told I’m “overthinking.”  Secondly, I’m extremely young. I always tell myself, “you’re in high school, not even a sophomore, and you’re seriously going through this?” I make myself believe that for someone my age, I should focus on doing my homework and having a social life. To add on, people my age (my school specifically) shun those with depression. People at my school make it seem you’re one of those weird kids (the tumblr SJWs) if you come out with depression. As much I say don’t judge people, obviously I still want a reputation of being healthy and caring. I hate myself for that so I bury my emotions in fake smiles towards everyone when I really think of just leaving this place...  Lastly, I brainwashed myself to make my reasons sound stupid. If you read before, I said I have depression because of my inability to keep up academically and disappointing everyone. I also gained it from feeling like a burden to my family (and even doctors) because of my illnesses. I make myself think others always have it worse. “You’re being scolded by your biology teacher because you don’t know how to dihybrid crosses? And you have depression because of that? Seriously?” Is what I’ll say. I just feel like I’m never good enough, I will never be good enough. My family won’t have to waste a dime on me if I’m dead. My doctors won’t have to care if I’m dead. My teachers won’t have to worry about failing a stupid student if I’m dead. My friends won’t hear me complain and annoy them if I’m dead.   TLDR; I need help and I have no idea how to make myself stop thinking the world would be better if I’m not here. I continually say others have it worse and nobody would think it’s a legitimate reason why I should be depressed. I can’t stop saying nobody will understand/care and that I’m just an over-thinker because boys my age should be doing school work and not complain until they get to the real world. ",sw,0,0.087,0.196
224,"Help me please. I'm a 20 year old man from the Netherlands, who is turning 21 in a few days. I've been dealing with depression for about 7 or 8 years now.  When I was a teen, my mother did not know how to deal with me because I used to be very hotheaded and hyperactive, which led to her and me having daily arguments. My father was almost always working, so he wasn't often there for me, and if he was home, he didn't want anything to do with his kids. My sister is a person I have trouble being around. She berates me for a whole lot of things I have very little control over (I'll state why later).  When my parents divorced, I quickly started to blame myself over it because I always fought with my mother and felt that I ruined their marriage. I was quickly starting to fail my last year in elementary school and ended up scoring way lower than the teachers expected me to score. Middle school was even worse as I quickly before the person to bully by my class and by a few others which only helped to destroy my already damaged self-esteem and self-worth.  By the time I was in middle school, my mother had a new husband, who was a very abusive person, both verbally and physically. He is now out of my life luckily, but he gave my mother permanent hand damage, he gave my sister a scar on her leg, and he damaged my shoulder and upper back. Whenever I wasn't fighting with my mother or step-father, they were fighting with each other.  I had to go to my father's every two weekends, and half the time during holidays. The first few times went well, where I actually spend time with him, but that all spiraled down once my step-mother came into the picture. I started to shut myself in because she was someone I had never seen before and I couldn't trust new people easily already. My depression gradually and steadily worsened around that time too, and none of my parental figures knew what to do with me. My mother and step-father argued with me all the time, while my father and step-mother didn't bother to ask me if I wanted to do anything and let me just stay in bed all day long. I even stopped joining them for dinner at one point.  When I turned 16, I was taken out of my home situation and I was put in a clinic so I could learn how to fend for myself (because no one had tried to teach me and I had literally no skills to do anything.) While I was at the clinic, I took a brain scan which revealed something about myself that worsened my self-worth even further: There was something wrong with my brain. For whatever reason, my brain is always overactive and takes up a whole lot of my energy, kind of like a burn-out. Over my whole life I got berated by literally almost everyone as lazy when it was actually a medical issue.  Fast forward some time and I was in court as a 17 year old because I originally wanted to remove any form of parental rights over my father because he didn't bother to do anything for me (because he didn't know what he could do), but the judge ultimately ruled for the opposite after asking me, which was that he was forced to seek contact with me.  Around that time, I learned that I am bisexual with a heavy preference for men, which I confided in my mother with her promising to not tell anyone. I quickly learned that that was the wrong choice, as not even after a week, everyone on my mother's side of the family knew about it. My sister literally wanted to cut off all contact with me for being lgbt, which she only didn't because her boyfriend told her to stop being so stupid.  This resulted in spiraling even further down into my self-loathing, and completely destroying my self-confidence and self-worth, and I was put on antidepressants. However, I was quickly taken off of them after telling them I started to see mental images of very gory self-mutilation.  When I turned 18, I was discharged from the clinic and now I live supervised in a home with 3 other people. My father had stopped contacting me completely the moment I turned 18, and by then my mother divorced her second husband. Fast forward 2 uneventful years of me trying desperately to get out of bed in the morning.  My grandmother on my father's side died, which resulted in me and my sister both regaining contact with our father. The contact between him and me is alright now, and I've stayed at his home for new years a few months back. The relationship with my mother is now okay again, and we don't fight as much anymore. However, that's pretty much all the good news that has happened.  My sister and I still barely have any contact, my mother and I barely have any contact, and even though my father and I are on good terms again, the contact is sparse. Financially I'm having trouble almost every month, as because of my brain problem, I'm unable to work, and I'm not eligible for a disability check, because ""I have worked in the past so I should be able to hold a job"", and now that I'm turning 21 in a few days, my alimony has stopped as well. I'm having more trouble than ever to try to get out of bed and go to bed at a reasonable time. I was put on a different brand of antidepressants, but I couldn't bother taking them anymore because they simply didn't do anything. I have one person on this world that I am able to really trust, and he lives on the different side of the earth.  I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm unable to allow people close to me and when they do, I mask my feelings without even thinking about it. I don't feel like I have a purpose to be alive on this world. I don't know if people say they care about me if they really mean it. I feel alone, abandoned, with no hope left. People tell me to ""look for a hobby to occupy yourself with"" but even that's out of reach for me when I get tired after doing groceries at a store 10 minutes away from my home.  I've ended my time with my psychologist because eventually she started berating me and telling me ""you need to start finding something to do during the day"" and ""you need to start working on a sleep schedule"" as if I don't understand that, and the professional therapist I would've gotten literally said the following works to me. ""You cannot be depressed because you said it with a smile"".  I think that I have no purpose on this earth and I'm beyond help. I've been tethering on the edge of ending it and be done with it for everyone's sake, or cling to the (almost) fake hope that someone will find me, pick me up and help me through my problems.  EDIT 4/7: I forgot to note a few things. The few friend groups I'm in, I tried to reach out for help, multiple times even, and every time it ends in one of two things: ""tough love"" and people telling me to get over it basically and that I'm being over-dramatic, or people completely ignoring me.",sw,0,0.075,0.104

No college, no job, no dream, nothing. It's not just because of my depression, I just don't see myself after high school.

I'm not sure why, but I couldn't handle anther night of being stuck in my own head.  I've been struggling with depression and anxiety most of my life, but managed to continue due to achieving the milestones of a normal life. I did well at school, did university and qualified as a doctor. I was getting on with things and from the outside probably looked successful. I got married, and got a mortgage and all that.  But then at 30, I had what I can only term a breakdown. I think it was a combination of hugely antisocial work, a few traumatising experiences on the job, but whatever triggered it, I fell apart. I quit my job, and took 6 months off where I began to feel better.  I then decided to retrain in a less stressful branch of medicine, which I've been doing for the past 2 years. And again, things are going well, had a baby, bought a house.  And I can feel it starting again.  My whole life has been dominated by trying to achieve. But because of this, I've neglected everything else. I've got no friends as when I was breaking down I retreated into myself, started drinking, basically shut down. I have no interests. And hate my job, which is not well paid and still has shit hours.  I had my first breakdown episode at school after a relationship broke down, then had another at university during finals. But I always had family to pick me up.  I first started having suicidal thoughts a few years ago. They became really bad last year, to the point I wrote goodbye letters and practiced hanging myself, but didn't complete.  Now I'm lying here, and can only think of my daughter as a reason to live. I don't like my life at all. I'd happily die in an accident or of an illness, but I'm too cowardly to kill myself. I hope I will die soon, but have a horrible feeling I might live quite a few years more.  Sorry for long post, thanks for listening ",sw,0,0.06,0.213

I don't know where to start so I'm just going to start venting. I am 25 and have battled with depression for most of my adult life. I would say a huge factor in this is my father. He's a good person and loves me I know, but he has his own demons. There is a very personal past with my grandfather that gave him his own issues mostly anger. This led me to spend most of my pubescent time doing what my dad wanted me to do. Spending time with him, trying to make him happy, trying to keep him from getting angry. I think the main result of this was at the time I should have been developing social skills I wasn't. This left me with crippling social anxiety and I have no true friends and I often feel I have no clue how to communicate, especially with the opposite sex. I'm extremely extremely lonely. There is much more to this but I don't want to get too personal in public. This started me down my path.   Couple this with the fact that when was 21 I was diagnosed with a chronic back condition. While we were diagnosing this and figuring out what treatment works for me I spent months in bed and slipped into a deep depression that i spent years ignoring. I spent some of this time contemplating suicide very seriously just to escape the pain. Eventually we were able to control the pain but the depression stayed.   Fast forward to last year bad I finally sought help for the depression and anxiety issues I have been having. I have been fighting for every inch of progress and I feel like I have a mountain left to climb. I still battle with a certain disregard for whether I wake up in the morning if not actively suicidal.   Now I have had a massive resurgence of back pain that hasn't responded to treatment and I am spending 24 hours a day in near unbearable pain. I don't want to live if this is what existence is going to be like. The pain has consumed my mind and I can't help but pause for a second every time I see a viable way to stop the pain. The pain has become everything I am, consumed me and my mind. All I can think about is ending this pain. The loneliness, the emotional pain, and the physical.   I have no fight left. I have lost all will and energy to resist and I'm scared of what every passing hour of pain is bringing me closer to. I've admitted that I will be alone forever and I'm afraid I will be in pain forever. I don't want all that pain to last for another 50 years. I enjoy nothing and have no one.

Having Asian family and being the middle child, I was ignored and abused. I was bullied in school for not being a ""gangsta""-clique in a school in the middle of nowhere/valley at the time. My 1st relationship ended up abusive verbally, physically, and I used to be a sex before marriage mentality until he deflowered me against my will. I finally was able to leave him when he cheated on me. (thank GOD).  My next relationship after that had pride, ego, and anger issues. I didn't want to look for a relationship but things happen -- and the worse happened with him. We never made it official but he kept me down when I was coming up as a freelancer. I left him too.  In the industry I'm in, every company or entity I've worked with was full-force sexism. Because I never had a career before and only one job I was taken advantage of and severely underpaid. Because this is a form of the music industry I've even had people offer me ""have sex with me and I'll give you access to all my connections"" to ""I'm taking your gigs and doing them for free"" to push me out. It's a full on boys world.  Now I'm stuck day after day with different companies being a freelancer in the city. A female freelancer. I tried having a part time for a few months and even ended up with a manager who is male dominant  suppressed LGBTQ who is too focused on his pride than his business to treat any of his workers well with a turn over rate of people leaving within a month or so.

It's a really beautiful painting and my grandfather usually has pretty great stories so I asked him about it. He said that it was kind of a funny story;   When he was in college his grandmother lived nearby so he would sometime go visit her, one of her favorite things to do was to go to an auction house nearby. One weekend he and his grandmother went to the auction house together to watch the auction, they had a general rule just to watch and not to buy anything. They were walking around, just looking around at the things for sale when my grandfather saw this painting. He asked the auctioneer how much a painting like that might go for, the auctioneer said that it really depended on who was buying that day. So my grandfather and his mother moved on to look at the other items.   A little later as the auction was going on the painting came up for sale, people were bidding on the painting like crazy so my grandfather jokingly raised his paddle, Sure enough, he won the auction, the painting was his for $500. Except, he didn't have $500, so his grandmother (who was quite wealthy) decided to buy it for him. He also didn't have the space for this painting, so he sent it home to his mom's house.   When my grandfather got home for summer break his siblings got wind of the $500 painting his grandmother got for him, they were not pleased. So his grandmother decided to write all his siblings a check for $500 and his mom decided that she would like to keep the painting. In the end, my grandfather, a broke college student, ended up with a painting that stayed in his mom's house until she died and his siblings ended up with a $500 check.   It's kinda a funny story now, but I can imagine it was not so funny at the moment. My grandfather finished the story by saying ""It is what it is, and it's a whole hell of a lot easier to laugh than it is to cry.""

442,"I set fire to everything I touch I have lost all hope, and I have no where else to turn. I have no friends to talk to, and I haven’t spoken to my family in almost 2 years.    Basically I have suffered from depression in some form since I was around 13. I will be 31 on Sunday and I can’t take it anymore.  I can’t remember a time in my life where my parents ever hugged me or gave me any affection, and the have never told me they loved me. However they have told me how much of a loser I am, and been overly critical of everything I have ever done. So realizing that they were toxic for me, I ceased all communication with them, and forfeit any ideas that they would ever change.  They last 3 or 4 years, things have just gotten unbearable for me. I think the depression flared up in a major way when my wife miscarried our first child. The whole situation really sent me into a downward spiral that I have yet to recover from. That event brought a lot of stress and problems into our marriage. During that time, I began seeing a physiatrist and also began taking medication. This seemed to help somewhat with my mood, but it also introduced side effects and I began the carousel of medication changes.  About a year later we got pregnant again, and later my daughter was born. I really feel like my depression robbed me of that euphoric feeling of endless love for your child that everyone describes. I really felt nothing, although I know I was “supposed” to love her.  Soon after (2 months) my daughter was born, my wife could not take living with a depressed person any more and she decided to move out with her mother, and we separated.  I continued to go to therapy, and my phycologist, to try and improve my symptoms, and get my family back. For the next six months things just seemed to get worse between us, and it all led me to a suicide attempt. It failed obviously, but it led me to be hospitalized in a psychiatric unit, were I was once again but on diffent meds.   Through all of this I continued therapy after getting out, and eventually convinced my wife to do couples therapy, all in hopes I would get my only friend back, and be able to bond and build a relationship with my young daughter.  She eventually decided to file for divorce. She said it was to protect or daughter, from me being able to get her at anytime. She wanted legal print in place for protection basically. Obviously my condition continued to deteriorate, but we were still trying to work on things. I voluntarily checked myself into a different, highly acclaimed, physiatrist hostpital to try and address my suicidal feelings and depression I had been suffering from the past several years.  Once again, things got momentarily better, but soon after I was still feeling the same and having the same thoughts of harming myself.  This pattern continued and eventually she finalized the divorce, I was hospitalized again, I lost my wife, and my daughter. She got the courts to agree that I am unable to see my daughter without supervision. So basically I can’t be alone with her. It makes it very difficult to do since I have no friends, and the only family I have that I speak to and that cares about me is my 80 year old grandmother.  During this time I also was looked over for a promotion at work that I told I was going to get but didn’t.  I have never given up hope that we could get back together and we would be able to be a family, and I would get better and get to be close to my daughter.  But to top it all off, I just found out my ex wife has now began dating someone new. She was my only friend, and now that she is seeing someone, she keeps conversation strictly to our now 2 year old daughter.   So the only 2 people I have in this world is my daughter, who won’t even hug me. And my grandmother, and when I lose her I don’t know what I will do.   I have thought about suicide multiple times a day for as long as I can remember. It’s really the only thing that could end the pain. I am not an easy person to get along with and I have so little self worth, and no redeeming qualities, that I truly believe my daughter would be much better off without me. Especially if I were to go now while she is young and has formed no memories of me.  I’m really just rambling at this point, and it is probably a wall of text, but I have no where else to turn, as I have since given up on meds and therapy and have just become a, resentful, bitter, depressed and suicidal person who is literally unlovable.",sw,0,0.09,0.128

465,"I obsessively segment, reverse and visualize words in my head. I also count the amount of letters in the words. I am constantly taking words I hear or see throughout the day and breaking them into pieces in my head.  For instance, the word ""hospital"" would become hos-pi-tal to keep an even amount of letters on each side of a pivotal couple of letters in the middle.  It could also become hosp-ital but that's less satisfying.  If it's a word with an odd number of letters I'll only put one letter in the middle, such as chev-r-olet.    Not as commonly, I'll reverse words and pronounce them backwards, also in my head.  I also count the letters in the words I'm visualizing.  So if someone were to ask me how many letters are in the word ""conversation"", I would be able to instantly answer 12 without having to think, because I've ran most of the common words through my head dozens if not hundreds of times.  I also take the first letter or two of two words and swap them, so saying ""I'm going to take a shower"" turns into ""I'm going to shake a tower.""    I'm a fully functioning adult with a great career so this doesn't impact me financially in any way, but it does on occasion cause me to ""get lost"" in the word manipulation and I stop listening to people.  Normally I can do all of this and still listen, but some of the tougher, longer words cause me to really get quite in-depth.

468,"My Step-dad I decided to share my dad’s story here in the hope that maybe someone might take comfort in it, or that it might save someone’s life somehow. He was actually my step-dad but was in my life from the age of 5.   My dad suffered with emotional issues his entire life, stemming from years of verbal abuse from his parents. He was told he was stupid, that he would never amount to anything. His dad showed no interest in his life (my dad played hockey as a teenager and his dad went to one game in all the years he played, and it was only because his co-worker’s son was playing on the other team).   In August 2014, my dad came out of his bedroom and collapsed in our Kitchen. We thought he was having a stroke, and called an ambulance. He was rushed to hospital and was initially diagnosed with Meningitis without any of the proper diagnostic tests. He returned home and remained sick for an entire month. After his mental status began to deteriorate further and it seemed like he was getting worse, we took him back to the hospital and he was re-admitted. The day after we received a note in our mailbox that told us his boss had set him up to get sick in order to get him out of his workplace, and had someone put pesticides and pills in his food. In other words, he was poisoned. He was treated and recovered but noone was every found guilty or charged.  Following his poisoning he developed PTSD. He saw his psychiatrist who diagnosed him one time and never again after that. For the next two years he went to counselling and a psychologist, stayed off work from his former workplace on stress leave and went to work somewhere else, started going to the gym, was healthier and seemed happier. Little did we know his silent struggle underneath the happy facade he put on for us all.   January 29th, 2018.   My mom and I woke up around 9am. I found a note on my bed that said “I love you son”. My mom found one on her phone that said ‘I’ll love you forever”. His phone was still on the counter. His car was in the driveway. He left no note to say he was going somewhere. The little notes he left us weren’t alarming at first because he left notes for us from time to time. He hadn’t let the dog out of his cage which was unusual as he always did. I let him outside, and noticed our back door was still locked. We only ever used the back door; He rarely used the front unless someone was picking him up. My mom called his best friend to find out if he was with him; he wasn’t. She checked his phone to see if there were any calls or texts that morning. There weren’t. She found texts between him and his counsellor; he had cancelled all of his appointments in December 2017 and January 2018, lying about being sick and getting a full-time job.   My mom started to panic and decided to look at our security camera to see if someone picked him up. She knew he had gotten up at 6:30am that morning as she had heard him rummaging in his dresser and had turned over to look at him before going back to sleep. It wasn’t unusual for him to get up early as he sometimes had trouble sleeping and would go for a walk or watch TV.   6:38am. He walked out the front door carrying a plastic grocery bag with something in it. He walked out to the end of our driveway, turned to look back at our house for a few seconds, and then turned away and walked down the street. My mom panicked and went to check his drawers; all of his pills were gone.   10:00am. We immediately went to his parent’s and grandparent’s house (they had two houses on one lot; his grandparent’s are both deceased). We knew that was the only place he would go if he was going to hurt himself. He took the only set of keys, so we couldn’t get into either house. We didn’t want to break a window as his parents are very crooked people and would likely have us charged with B&E if we did and he wasn’t there.  10:30am. We went to the police. They didn’t take us seriously; had us go back home and wait for an officer to come to our house. The officer showed up, asked us questions, and told us to drive around and look for him while they looked at getting into the houses.  11:30am-12:30pm. We drove around our little town (we checked the cemetery where his grandparents are buried and checked some other places he might have gone, called some of his friends etc.). At 12:30 his best friend called us and told us the police found him in his grandparent’s house and to get there quickly as he was unresponsive. It was the most terrifying thing. We pulled up, and my mom and I fell apart as we walked up to the house. We were thinking he would be dead. They wouldn’t let us inside to see him. They told us he was breathing and that he would go straight to the city as he would need to go to a Psychiatric unit after he recovered. We started to head that way. We hadn’t even been driving 5 minutes and the police called my mom again and told us that his breathing wasn’t stable enough and he needed to go to our local hospital first to be stabilized.   1:30pm. He arrived in the ER and they started working on him. He had overdosed intentionally. He received 11 doses of Narcan and was put on a Narcan IV drip. He had ingested multiple narcotic medications, some of which were his from his hospitalization in 2014; some were his parent’s from their house. After 3-4 hours he went up to ICU. They told us he needed to get the drugs out of his system to stabilize and then he would go to Psych. He woke up periodically after a narcan dose was administered. He knew he was in the hospital and tried sitting up to hug my mom. He actually said “hospital”, when asked if he knew where he was.  5:30pm. My mom and I decided to go home to let the dog out and eat something. We didn’t even make it half way (12 minute drive), and the hospital called us back. His breathing had deterioriated and they needed to intubate to maintain his airway. We turned around and went back. They intubated him; it took three attempts and he vomited during the process, aspirating into his lungs.   8:00pm. My dad was unstable and needed to be transferred to a better equipped hospital. He was transferred to one in the city.   For the next three or four days we were hopeful. He showed signs up waking up when they lowered his sedatives. They told us once he recovered and could come off the ventilator, he would go to psych and then we would deal with it from there.   That isn’t what happened.   He wasn’t able to be extubated the first week as he was very agitated whenever they lowered the sedation. The second week, he started having seizures. His ET tube (Endotracheal tube) that was his life support started leaking and couldn’t be changed for two days. The hospital staff didn’t listen to us when we kept saying he was having seizures. They told us it was just shivering from his fever (he had persistent fevers after he aspirated because he developed aspiration pneumonia). He went two days having untreated seizures. On the 3rd day, the doctor acknowledged his seizures but didn’t prescribe any anti-convulsants. He went two more days with no intervention. On the 5th day the neurologist finally consulted and he was put on anticonvulsants. He ended up on three different medications. On the 7th day he went for an MRI and had a seizure for an hour and a half. At this time he was transferred to another hospital.   At the other hospital we were told he was not being oxygenated properly. They suspected a hypoxic brain injury. At this point we had not seen him open his eyes for almost two weeks. They ran more tests. He developed infections. They told us they couldn’t tell how bad his brain damage was unless they treated his infections; but that he would need to have a tracheostomy put in as the ET tube needed to be removed (they are typically only used for 2 weeks max; he had his for 3 1/2 at this point).   This was where my mom had to make the hardest decision of her life. Where I has to support her through it. We were told if they did a tracheostomy that there was no going back; that he could recover but if he did have brain damage there would be no way of ending life support, unless he required a feeding tube and we could stop that, essentially starving him to death.   We decided to end life support, as he would not want to recover if he could not go home 100% who he was before. He had left 5 notes that were found with him. In one he stated he wanted to donate his organs. So we looked at organ donation. In the end due to infection he was only able to donate his kidneys. But in his death he did save two lives.   The worst part of all of it was the end. They removed his life support and we all sat with him. He needed to die within two hours to remain an elligible donor. We sat there for two hours, listening to the sounds of him dying. The sound of his breathing will haunt me for the rest of my life. It is the worst thing that I have ever experienced (and I am a nurse professionally). I wish that experience upon noone. At one point he opened his eyes, and I cried, because I couldn’t stand watching him suffer and struggle to breath. Knowing that the medications he was receiving were making it harder for him. It was so upsetting to watch; and with my mom by my side it was that much harder watching her fall apart as the love of her life passed away.   We were listening to all of his favourite music while we waited. He loved 80’s hair bands. And for the last hour we listened to a random Ozzy Osbourne playlist on Youtube. He took his last breath right at the two hour mark when we thought all hope was lost. We didn’t notice until later, but the last song I had playing on my phone was “See You On The Other Side” by Ozzy Osbourne. He died halfway through the song.   February 24th, 2018. The day we heard his last breath.  I am going to be burying his ashes today, two months later. I’ve been back to work. I haven’t started counselling yet but I know that I need to. I have no sense of time. My short term memory is all but gone. Even some of my long-term memory is gone right now. But I remember each and every detail of the whole ordeal with crystal clarity. My mom is staying off of work on stress leave while she deals with his affairs.   I miss him so much. I wish he would have come to me, talked to me, asked for help. But all I can think about is how much he suffered. He must have been in such terrible pain; and while I love him and wish he was still here, I am happy for him that he is in a better place and is no longer suffering. It’s just a shame; he was so young, at just 41 years old. I myself am only 22 years old and I find it strange being so young and having to bury a parent.   To anyone having suicidal thoughts, or who had attempted suicide, know that I acknowledge your pain. It is not all in your head. It is not made up. It is real, and legitimate, and you don’t deserve to suffer that way. I hope that our story may encourage you to seek help, if only so that you don’t risk suffering in the way that my dad did in the hospital for a month. It’s degrading and I know my dad would have been so angry and humiliated to have seen himself in that hospital bed, unable to eat, needing a catheter to urinate, a rectal tube to prevent him from messing the bed all the time. He would have been so infuriated with himself for putting himself in that position, and knowing how he felt about us I think he would be angry with himself for putting my mom and I through all of it in the process. But I don’t blame him, nor am I angry with him. I still love him and I always will. I do not wish any of this on anyone.   Take care dad. I miss you. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of mom like you asked. I love you more than you will ever know. I only wish I had said it more often. I love you. ",sw,0,0.08,0.116

He isn't a bad person but his good intentions have caused a lot of pain and heartbreak between me, my mother, and my sister. I guess I could call him a toxic person. Very emotionally abusive, but not physically.   When I was 13 my parents split (more like, my mom came to her senses, grabbed my sister and me, and ran away). A restraining order was placed. Again, he never hit us, but it was more of a precaution considering his mental instability.  A few months ago I turned 18, meaning the restraining order no longer applied to me. I knew he would try to find me but I also knew that whenever that inevitably happened, I wouldn't know how to handle it.   The other day I opened my campus mailbox to find two letters from him. One of them was a simple Happy Easter card. The other one had a large quantity of bills, and a check for a LOT of money made out to my university (paying off tuition has been a struggle).   I was pretty freaked out, and compulsively deposited the check  (I know I should've waited). But now that he knows I've opened it, I feel the need to say something back to him.

494,"Help me please. I'm a 20 year old man from the Netherlands, who is turning 21 in a few days. I've been dealing with depression for about 7 or 8 years now.  When I was a teen, my mother did not know how to deal with me because I used to be very hotheaded and hyperactive, which led to her and me having daily arguments. My father was almost always working, so he wasn't often there for me, and if he was home, he didn't want anything to do with his kids. My sister is a person I have trouble being around. She berates me for a whole lot of things I have very little control over (I'll state why later).  When my parents divorced, I quickly started to blame myself over it because I always fought with my mother and felt that I ruined their marriage. I was quickly starting to fail my last year in elementary school and ended up scoring way lower than the teachers expected me to score. Middle school was even worse as I quickly before the person to bully by my class and by a few others which only helped to destroy my already damaged self-esteem and self-worth.  By the time I was in middle school, my mother had a new husband, who was a very abusive person, both verbally and physically. He is now out of my life luckily, but he gave my mother permanent hand damage, he gave my sister a scar on her leg, and he damaged my shoulder and upper back. Whenever I wasn't fighting with my mother or step-father, they were fighting with each other.  I had to go to my father's every two weekends, and half the time during holidays. The first few times went well, where I actually spend time with him, but that all spiraled down once my step-mother came into the picture. I started to shut myself in because she was someone I had never seen before and I couldn't trust new people easily already. My depression gradually and steadily worsened around that time too, and none of my parental figures knew what to do with me. My mother and step-father argued with me all the time, while my father and step-mother didn't bother to ask me if I wanted to do anything and let me just stay in bed all day long. I even stopped joining them for dinner at one point.  When I turned 16, I was taken out of my home situation and I was put in a clinic so I could learn how to fend for myself (because no one had tried to teach me and I had literally no skills to do anything.) While I was at the clinic, I took a brain scan which revealed something about myself that worsened my self-worth even further: There was something wrong with my brain. For whatever reason, my brain is always overactive and takes up a whole lot of my energy, kind of like a burn-out. Over my whole life I got berated by literally almost everyone as lazy when it was actually a medical issue.  Fast forward some time and I was in court as a 17 year old because I originally wanted to remove any form of parental rights over my father because he didn't bother to do anything for me (because he didn't know what he could do), but the judge ultimately ruled for the opposite after asking me, which was that he was forced to seek contact with me.  Around that time, I learned that I am bisexual with a heavy preference for men, which I confided in my mother with her promising to not tell anyone. I quickly learned that that was the wrong choice, as not even after a week, everyone on my mother's side of the family knew about it. My sister literally wanted to cut off all contact with me for being lgbt, which she only didn't because her boyfriend told her to stop being so stupid.  This resulted in spiraling even further down into my self-loathing, and completely destroying my self-confidence and self-worth, and I was put on antidepressants. However, I was quickly taken off of them after telling them I started to see mental images of very gory self-mutilation.  When I turned 18, I was discharged from the clinic and now I live supervised in a home with 3 other people. My father had stopped contacting me completely the moment I turned 18, and by then my mother divorced her second husband. Fast forward 2 uneventful years of me trying desperately to get out of bed in the morning.  My grandmother on my father's side died, which resulted in me and my sister both regaining contact with our father. The contact between him and me is alright now, and I've stayed at his home for new years a few months back. The relationship with my mother is now okay again, and we don't fight as much anymore. However, that's pretty much all the good news that has happened.  My sister and I still barely have any contact, my mother and I barely have any contact, and even though my father and I are on good terms again, the contact is sparse. Financially I'm having trouble almost every month, as because of my brain problem, I'm unable to work, and I'm not eligible for a disability check, because ""I have worked in the past so I should be able to hold a job"", and now that I'm turning 21 in a few days, my alimony has stopped as well. I'm having more trouble than ever to try to get out of bed and go to bed at a reasonable time. I was put on a different brand of antidepressants, but I couldn't bother taking them anymore because they simply didn't do anything. I have one person on this world that I am able to really trust, and he lives on the different side of the earth.  I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm unable to allow people close to me and when they do, I mask my feelings without even thinking about it. I don't feel like I have a purpose to be alive on this world. I don't know if people say they care about me if they really mean it. I feel alone, abandoned, with no hope left. People tell me to ""look for a hobby to occupy yourself with"" but even that's out of reach for me when I get tired after doing groceries at a store 10 minutes away from my home.  I've ended my time with my psychologist because eventually she started berating me and telling me ""you need to start finding something to do during the day"" and ""you need to start working on a sleep schedule"" as if I don't understand that, and the professional therapist I would've gotten literally said the following works to me. ""You cannot be depressed because you said it with a smile"".  I think that I have no purpose on this earth and I'm beyond help. I've been tethering on the edge of ending it and be done with it for everyone's sake, or cling to the (almost) fake hope that someone will find me, pick me up and help me through my problems.",sw,0,0.068,0.106

I'd love to hear about all of your greatest adventures on the roads of the world.  And spare no details :D  My favorite roadtrip is between one of these three:  1. Chicago to Portland, through Canada. We went up to Bemidji State Park in Minnesota in ten hours, made camp and canoed the next day. Then we were at Winnipeg, Manitoba, and I played drums at a really cool blues jam. Then we crossed the continent, and during that time was probably the most at peace I've ever been in my life, driving over the Continental Divide. When we hit Banff, we were floored at how beautiful it was. We spent three days camping in different places around there, went to a party in Vancouver, and then hung out in Portland for five days being ents and playing more music.  2. All the same guys on the first one swam in every single great lake in 8 days. We went Chicago, Minneapolis, Thunder Bay, and then 2 days of camping, Toronto, and then we played a house party in Niagara. That was amazing.  How about you all?",cc,1,0.229,0.021

The only thing stopping me is that I know that whatever I do to improve my life (including ending it) will always make my life worse.

558,"I took the first step in my plan today.. Here's a little bit of back story first.    Basically, I had a kid, and i asked my parents to take guardianship. I was in a bad relationship and stupidly put his name on the kids birth certificate. He's a domestic terrorist, and gets supervised visitation. And hasn't even tried to see the kid in a little over a year. So my first step is making sure that my parents fully adopt this kid, so that he can never get any kind of rights. Since my parents have been saving up money I thought now would be a good time to call our lawyer and figure this out.  I know it'll probably take all year, but that's all part of the plan.   I started a job where I work 96 hours a week, and i make close to 4k a month. What I'm going to do is work, save up money and once I kill myself I'll have all the money I owe my family in envelopes with the letters I'm gonna leave them.  I owe my parents about 3k, and i owe my grandparents about 12k. If I end up making more than that, I'm gonna try and leave the rest to my sister (the child I had).  I plan on getting a doctor to perscribe me the medicines I want, or really anything for that matter. Cause it dosnt actually matter what it is, cause if you can take enough of it, you should die.  I also plan on taking this time to snoop around and find a way into my grandpa's gun safe, and take his pistol. Just in case I feel like the pills arnt getting me anywhere. I'm debating on if I want to do it on a Facebook live post or just keep it low-key so nobody ruins it for me..  To be honest I've been planing this for like 6 months if not longer. I genuinely feel that I'll finally be a good person if I kill myself. I'll stop ruining everything for all the people around me.  I've wanted to die for over 10 years now.

559,"I'm messed up. For as long as I can remember I have lashed out at people who probably care about me (excluding family, my family doesn't know) out of fear of being someone that is disposable in their lives. In other words, I give people a reason to leave so that I'm not surprised when they do. I regret every word I say but they just keep coming.  As a first year student in university I made a large group of friends and had a particularly close relationship with one of those friends - we spent countless nights getting to know each other and so many personal details about each other, and we were basically inseparable. This person has since become the fourth person in as many years who decided that they were bored of me after I became emotionally dependent upon them. Since this happened, I have spent the last couple of months of my first year at university personally attacking all of my friends that I made here. Now I know everyone is sick of me and no matter how badly I want to apologize, every time I think to do so a fear so strong grips me and I can't help but to lash out again anyways. What is wrong with me? I care so deeply about all of these people and yet I continue to drive them away. Why do I do this to myself? I hate who I am. I hate having to live with myself. I thought I had gotten over my depression and had recovered completely from my first suicide attempt several years ago, but I'm back to regretting every morning that I wake up, every night that I survive instead of passing away in my sleep. I don't want to deal with me anymore, I haven't wanted to in years but the fact that not even going to school in a different country has changed how horrible I am convinces me that I don't deserve to be here anymore.

I will OD on drugs most likely or just go into the woods and starve to death.  sry for the long rant and lack of proper formatting   I am basically lying in bed all day every day and rotting my life away for YEARS now.. I have thoughts on my mind 24/7.. my mind is racing yet I am feeling dull and nothing affects me.. my whole life has been a waste.  I feel like nothing is real, nothing interests me, nothing excites me, I don't have any life energy left inside of me. I am not a person anymore, just an empty shell devoid of any real life.. my heart and organs may function, yet my brain constantly is fogged and poisoned with bad thoughts.  I have been alienating all my friends, my family is broken, and I have never had a girlfriend ever and I wont at this point. It is impossible. I am a short person at 172cm and my personality is a complete mess. That is what 15+ years of being depressed can do to you. I am such a different person to who I used to be.   I am deeply unhappy with every single cell of my being. I was always obsessed about my looks going to the gym and watching my nutrition, but for what? I was always unhappy in my own skin, I could never satisfy my standards, I always wished I was someone else.. I wanted to live, I just never wanted to live my own life. Nowadays I just don't want to live, no matter what.  I am a narcisst and I am my own worst enemy.. I dread every day, I can't even watch movies or read or do anything.. I just stare at the wall and sleep, wake up, sleep again.   I have no dreams left. I am rapidly getting older, I realize my best years have been all a waste, I have nothing to look forward to, I should have taken my life years ago already, but I am a coward as well. I dont want to live yet I dont want to die, I just want to be DEAD without the process of having to die.    I have been fighting every day to somehow reach my goals of making at least a bit of money through different things.. and then I lost almost all of my money the last week, while I was blackout drunk. Or maybe it got stolen. I am 32 years old and I am a complete mess at this point. I am ashamed of myself, so I will always tell lies about my life to people that don't know me very well.  Nothing ever goes right.   I accept that. I mean we are animals after all, there is no guarantee of living a happy life or even a mediocre life. I guess I was stupid enough to somehow believe this hollywood good ending story shit growing up, or that really bad stuff can somehow don't affect me.. maybe a positive optimism but in my case it was delusional. I never worked on myself after it was all too late, I never got any help, I always repressed everything, I was always too scared to to anything about my problems which were well-known to me at a younger age already, however I just repressed and repressed and hoped everything would magically get better in some way.. or maybe I didn't hope it would get better and actually just didnt give a shit and with my passive agression against myself, I was constantly sabotaging myself to the point where I am at now. I hated myself deep down even when I was a kid. I feel like I deserve this shitty life after all.  I guess at the same time, weirdly enough, I felt entitled to having a good or at least average life, because growing up I never had to work in school to pass exams and even in university I never had to really work much to pass my exams. I am disgusted by my own entitledness to be honest. I am a twisted person. I don't even understand myself fully.. but I know I am a coward. Some people from poorer countries would love to trade places with me, I have a healthy body, in a technologically advanced country, I am reasonably intelligent, I speak 5 languages.    But all of that doesn't matter when you are dead inside and dread living every day.. have nothing to look forward to and just want to be dead. I am thinking about blasting steroids before I take my life but I dont know.  If someone could get into my exact situation, it would take them maybe a year and they would have a decent apartment, a driver's license and all the things I never had because I never managed to accomplish them. I was never assertive, I guess I suffer from learned helplessness and feelings of powerlessness. That's why I am in the situation I am in today.

She's something like 4'10 and 95 lbs.  Anyway, I kept pulling her hair to mess with her, I kept doing it because she was getting really angry and it was funny. It got to the point where she threatened to beat me up if I did it again. I inevitably did it again and she pinned me, telling me to apologise. This went on for like 20 minutes and my arms didn't leave the floor for the whole time. I eventually apologised to her and she kept milking the apology (telling me to say it louder because she ""couldn't hear me"") until I was really embarrassed.  Not proud of this but when she let go, I stomped on her phone on the ground cracking the screen. She then wrapped her thighs around my waist and squeezed until I was submitting. She wouldn't let go and I threw up on the carpet.  I'm getting really insecure about my strength now. It felt like she had an insane amount of leg muscle. We've done body measurements before and her calves are larger than my thighs when tensed and her thighs are only a few inches off my waist size lol.

So now I am in an A-Level class.  And as of now I cannot keep my grade above a D in math or chem. Everyone else seems to get decent grades without even trying and it seems that no matter how hard I try I can never get straight a’s. One person in my math class consistently gets 100s on math tests, and I just feel so annoyed. I study, I do the homework, I stay after school for tutoring; I am the perfect student but my grades can never reflect that. I nearly failed out of Chemistry the FIRST SEMESTER, and to add the cherry on top. I failed the midterm despite agonizing over my grades nearly every school day. No matter what I do it is never enough. It’s never enough. Whether I study everyday before a test, or don’t study at all I can never get the grades I want no matter what I do. Today, our teacher gave us a pop quiz on a topic that we learnt two weeks ago, and my mind went blank. That grade will certainly drop me back down to an F, undoing everything I had worked so hard for this semester. It’s the 4th quarter of the year and I can’t take it anymore. I just want to kill myself so I won’t have to see the rest of this miserable semester through. I hate myself so much. Putting effort into school is nothing more than a waste of energy. If I go to my school counselor, she’ll just start going on about how I shouldn’t give up and that I still have my junior and senior years ahead of me. I feel that my life is already over. If I can’t pass high school math or chemistry class how on Earth am I supposed to excel in college or living? Cheating is not even an option because my teachers space the desks 3 miles apart. Dropping out is entirely off the table, because of my parents. Everyone keeps on saying that I should keep working hard and I shouldn’t lose hope.

We have one classic rock station that plays the same songs every day, an ""alternative"" station that does the same thing, and several pop stations that play the same songs every hour. I'm sure there are some others but all I know is I don't get to hear music I'm really a fan of on the radio. I currently have a few different songs stuck in my head that I heard on repeat today from the radio.  When I go to workout or chill at my head coach's office at the fitness center in my college, one of the pop stations is always playing. If I'm at the gym for longer than an hour I realize that I'll hear the same songs get played that were on earlier. I try to tune them out but it's playing so loudly that I can't always do that.   One thing that bothered me a year ago when I was working out was this: I did upperbody workouts around the same time every Thursday morning. Somehow, whether I got there earlier or later than usual or changed up my order of machines I used, it seemed that every week as soon as I got on the chest press machine Chained To The Rhythm by Katy Perry started playing. I don't like Katy Perry's music. In the entire semester I think only once this did not happen and I so so appreciated Justin Timberlake for bringing Sexy Back so I could go a workout without the Katy Perry song. I could workout with my own music, but I just see that as too much of a hassle, even with wireless headphones. I don't need music to motivate me either when working out.  I know a lot of people enjoy Spotify or Pandora, but I don't use them because I know the musicians I like would lose out on money from those radio apps. The sound engineer at my theater said one of his buddies had over 100,000 plays on a song on Spotify and didn't even get $2 from that. I much rather buy a CD (either physical or digital, but preferably physical) and upload it onto my iTunes playlist to put on my iPod.   When I first got my old iPod touch I had a metal radio station I downloaded that I enjoyed but I eventually deleted it. I did find a bunch of new bands (to me) through that app though.   I hope whenever I get a car it is recent enough that it'll have an aux cord for my iPod, but old enough that it has an actual CD player since I own a good amount of physical CDs.  Do you have any good radio stations by you?  When was the last time you bought an actual CD?  How do you feel about ""radio edit"" versions of songs?

I hate not being able to cry when I'm sad, I hate that I don't laugh as much, I hate not having a sex drive, I hate that if I miss a pill I feel like shit.  So I quit taking them, and eventually, the psychosis comes back. I get delusional, I hallucinate more, I get paranoid and anxious and I stop taking care of myself.  Usually, my delusions are nonsensical and they don't hurt anyone but me. Things like thinking 'They' (random shadow figures idk) are everywhere, watching me from wherever i'm not looking.

Or that everyone around me, especially cops/doctors/celebrities are lizard people wearing human skin.

But not the last time this happened, but the time before it, I thought my mom was trying to convince me to kill myself. I thought she had been doing exactly that since the day I was born, and everything she'd ever done was part of her trying to convince me to kill myself. I cut her off and I really hurt her. Things are okay now, but it made me realize that I'm capable of hurting people. And what if i have a delusion that someone is trying to hurt me, and I ""defend myself""?

I can't do this anymore. I don't know what to do. There are no solutions to this, there's nothing that can fix it, this is just what my life is. Miserable and medicated, or miserable, crazy, but unmedicated.  I'm also thousands of dollars in debt with shitty credit due to hospital bills, including bills from my last suicide attempt.

728,"Out on the edge. Not sure how to start this. Been dating a girl for 4.5 years.  Things were good. I was happy, and a year after we started dating I got hit with a medical illness. Random pains in my body. I went from loving Disney songs to dreading the next day.  My anxiety and depression got worse. Feeling your body fall apart everyday is a shitty Feeling. Through out our relationship I contemplated suicide as a amazing option. I wrapped a belt around my neck, to amazing relief. It's hard to explain this feeling. Just amazing. It wasn't an attempt I was wondering were my state of mind was. Look in the mirror and it's a genuine smile. Comfort smile. Anyone know what I'm talking about? I kept getting worse medically and wanted to run away. I choose to drink the pain away and forget it. Through out that. My depression was numb and my gf stuck by me. On multiple occasions I felt so bad. Id say the wrong things when I drink. So if break up with her so I could suffer alone. She always came back. Me, I'm the kind of guy that  Doesn't like to deny people who want to be around me. In 2016 I tried to kill myself. Took 2 2mg Xanax bars, drove down to rite aid bought  2 pints of whiskey. Started drinking at as ideas driving home. This is it for me. I'm done crushed up 4 or 5 more bars put them with rum and coke.  Rook.2 10mg valium pills. Decided to play my favorite game till i fade away. Spark up a joint listen to music and proceed to piss everyone off because I suck at the game. I remember getting lethargic and needing to throw up. I don't and just go.lay on the bed to watch tv. I fall asleep after downing more then a pint of whiskey. I stay asleep for 2 days. Woken up by my girlfriend, parents were gone. Came to the realization she could have found me dead. 2 weeks later, I decid that breaking up with her was the best thing to do. I'll be happy knowing I'm not being selfish keeping her around. So I do. I keep it a secret why I was breaking up with her. I don't like pity. She comes back a week later telling me she misses me. Wants to be there for me. Not even  a day I found a fentynal dealer. Tested it will a kit it was the real deal. I decided I'D try something different. Started anti deprsssents. And those reacted badly. I'd say things I regret.every now and then. I tried to leave a couple times during this. Anti deprsssents numbed me. I started drinking with it. So I decided to move with my parents to go cold turkey off them, stop drinking. Force myself out. Force myself to bring my mind and body back. I was done feeling like this.  When I go cold turkey  I knew I would have a badd day because on detox in off 30 mg off lexapro.  I quit drinking  I just need a month or 2 to bring myself back.    I have a badd day and she leaves.  Saying that she was thinking about this for years even though a year before I tried to break up with her and she came back promising me that she wanted to be there for me. I'm crushed.  I tried to leave her because of how depressed I was an anxious only to have her say nasty things to me in the end and throw me away when i trusted her.   I'm at that point where I want to kill myself again.  I honestly after 4 months am over the relationship.   But the words she said sting.  Why after me trying to let her go and her coming back And the and do I have to feel like I was abandoned feel like I did the right thing trying to let her go what I felt so bad.  And she leaves after me trying to feel good but just needed to detox off everything.  After that a friend got upset.  Hacked my things  And posted naked pictures of her on her social media.  All because I told him I'd give him back his items but I just was too depressed to log on.  Now hes threatening to post these pictures to all of her friends and he lives in another country and there's nothing I can do and he wants me to give him all of my items are he does it.   I really just want to go home right now.

During this class, it’s basically a built in work time where you’re meant to work on homework and whatnot. But basically, the people in my class, I cannot stand, and yesterday I couldn’t take it any more. I felt so small and unwanted in that class. So much so I left it crying. So come today, I asked my choir director if I could stay in the choir room instead of going to my normal class. While explaining why, I broke down into tears. She was so supportive though. She wrote me a pass to leave that class and so today I spent that time alone in the choir room, where it was just nice and quiet for once. My director had told me that I could come any time and to just ask for a pass from her. I’ve never really been close with any of my teachers, but she’s honestly so supportive in every way. She’s also inspired me to pursue a career in choral directing because she’s made such a big impact on me, and I want to be able to have the same impact on others.

People aren't evil, just self-centered and apathetic.  So I stopped dedicating my life solely to others and tried to fix myself. Therapy and meds weren't my solution, after years of trying cocktails of SSRI/SNRIs and too many therapists to count. None of that worked and im left with 2 options.

771,"I am at the lowest point of my life right now. Crying my eyes out I am writing this in tears. I am probably in the lowest point of my life right now. I don't know where to go from here.   I am nearly 25 years old. For my entire life I've been alone. I never had any friends, nothing. I was the loneliest person you could imagine. I would go through weeks without saying a word, forgetting how my voice sounds. All of high school - nothing. Never saw any human being outside of school hours. Didn't go to college, started working as a software developer right after high school.   I learned to live with it. I got by, day by day. Learned to live with myself. I would spend most of my waking hours in commuting to work, reading, and working out. That's it. I was depressed, but learned to live with the devil inside me. Perhaps every couple of weeks I'd go through an episode of depression, but all in all things were decent.   I had accepted my faith and learned to live with the cards I was dealt.    8 months ago a miracle happened. A colleague of mine, which I had a crush on (but then again in those days I would get a crush on anything with a heartbeat) began flirting with me and asked me out. I went through a panic attack when she did so, but managed to say yes and go on a date (which by the way, is one of my proudest moments - I had overcome so much to go on a date with her. I can't even begin to describe what I went through before that date. )   We ended up together. For over half a year. I was over the moon. Somebody cares about me. Somebody found me attractive. I had someone to talk to. I was having physical contact with another person for the first time in my life. I had sex. I had a friend. My first real friend. The first ever non family member human being to come into my room. I shared my life with her. Told her everything. My deepest secrets and fears.   It seemed like she was so into me, that till this day I remember several conversations with her, which I asked how is this even possible, and if I'm dreaming the whole thing. She even proposed to me and said she wants to be the mother of my children. We had even started looking for apartments together. I swear to God this is true. I really do. I know nobody will believe, but she did. She got down on her knees and proposed.   But then everything went down hill. I learned people are evil and cruel. I was a rebound from her previous relationship. She was never really over her ex. She cheated on me with him, and lied to me for months. Telling me she's with her friends or family, while she was at his place.    And I found out. Turns out you can gain some kind of social instincts, even if you're a complete loner.   But hey, she said she's sorry and I decided to forgive. What kind of idiot gives up on the first ever person to show them love?  So I tried to forgive her. We lasted for another month. And then she dumped me. Over text.   Never saw her again. Tried contacting her yesterday after two months, in hope for reconciliation. But she's over it. She forgot all her promises of being the mother of my children. Of marrying me and living with me.    And here I am. Crying my eyes out.  It finally hit me - I'm back where I was before this relationship. I'm all alone, I'm depressed, I'm crying.  I work 11-12 hours a day. Money piles up in the bank and I have nothing in my life to spend it on. I will never find someone new, I am back to being alone.   Only now, I've also seen the other side. I know what I'm missing. I know what holding hands in bed with another human being is like.   What's the point. I spend hours in front of a computer screen every day at work. Hours commuting. Sleep, work, eat, cry and talk to myself.   I have no reason to wake up in the morning. Is the potential grief of my parents a reason to keep living?

At this point, the program has filled all of their spots and there is absolutely nothing I can do except reapply next year.

807,"I’m [23f] afraid that my boyfriend [23m] gave up on life. - Sorry for the long post, tried to make it as short as possible but too much to explain -  First of all, this is a throw away account because my boyfriend is also on Reddit and I don’t want him to see this.  Me and my boyfriend are together for 6 years now. We met when we were 17 years old, in a club. Our relationship has been through a lot of ups and downs. He cheated on me two times, with two different girls. Yes, I know I should have left him when it happened, but he wasn’t really himself at that time, it will become clear later in the story. So I forgave him and he never did it again. (It happened when we were together for 5 months and when he was going out a lot and stopped going out when it happened) But that was just a short presume.   Also a short presume of his life. His parents were both alcoholics. They drank strong alcohol almost everyday, and would fight together where my boyfriend could see it. His mother had a liver disease and was clearly sick. His father was kinda healthy.   So after a year of being together, everything was going fine. He didn’t go out that much any longer and focused on his classes. On June 17th, we both had our finals, his father was supposed to get home from work(he was a taxi driver). But he didn’t answer his phone and didn’t came home, so my boyfriend went to look for him on the road. Not much later he found his dad dead in the taxi with a lot of police surrounded. He called me crying and I immediately went there. It was one of the painfullest things to see, ny boyfriend was devastated really. The funeral was so beautifull and sad.  Right when the father passed, it clearly got worse with his mother. She didn’t care about life anymore. She drank more and we were left alone with her. She used to drink so much that she couldn’t walk and would fall from the stairs. She woke up at 4pm and go to bed at 6am. We couldn’t go to bed before her because when we did, we found her bleeding on the ground. We had to call an ambulance a few times, it was so hard to see. We couldn’t work because if we left her alone, she would maybe make a deadly fall. Or attempt suicide. She used to cry and tell me and my boyfriend she wants to die and is doing everything to be with her husband as soon as possible. I think that was the worst my boyfriend could ever hear in his life.   Fast forward to 3 years later, his mom was terminal. She was in so much pain, she had trouble to eat. She was so thin, and no doctors would help us. We lived with all the struggles for about 3 years, with no help from nobody. We were both still kids and had no clue how to handle it. She died on September 10th. The police didn’t even tell us how she died, they accused us first, but shortly after they told us she died naturally, but no cause of death. We had to arrange her funeral all on our own when we were 21. We had absolutely no idea what to do so we called a professional, the funeral and everything costed about a 10k dollars.   My boyfriend was devastated and was in deep grief, but I didn’t see him cry so I think he is shock since then. He refused to go in therapy and he has no friends or family he can rely on. Only me.   The reason I think he gave up on life is because he just doesn’t care about his health or about anything at all. He refuses every help from a professional. He started to do hard drugs and soft drugs. Luckily he stepped off from the hard drugs because I threatened to leave him when he continued. But he is still smoking a lot and didn’t step off from the soft drugs yet. I tell him every day that I’m scared for his health but everytime he tells me that “he doesn’t care and how sooner he dies the better”. This hurts so much because I really love him and want to grow old with him. There are days that he tells me he wants to kill himself and when we argue he just leaves with the car and texts me that he is gonna end his life. He never really tried it tho but I’m afraid that he will one day. He doesn’t really look healthy neither, he eats French fries almost everyday and barely any vegetables. How can I help him and give him his will to live back? I really need some advice because I’m starting to lose my will to live too all because it’s draining so much energy.   Tl;dr: My [23f] boyfriend [23m] lost his both parents [55f & 60m] in three years. He doesn’t care about his health and says that how sooner he dies the better it is. I’m worried about him and want to save him from dark thoughts. ",sw,0,0.081,0.172
808,"I just wrapped up a project exploring the power of human conversation through photography There is such an intimacy in the photographer/subject relationship that few other interactions can mirror. When a subject sits for a shoot, they thrust themselves and their vulnerabilities under the spotlight. Baring all for the lens. Opening up to whatever it may capture, good or bad. Trusting the photographer's perspective. Being sincere and genuine in their expressions.     For the photographer, there is a reciprocal attempt to be honest with their subject. To try to capture them as they are.  To try to view the subject as they view themselves.  For the duration of a photographer's shoot, the world stands still. Nothing else matters but the subject in that moment.  Every ounce and atom of the photographer's undivided attention is directed towards their subject. They listen to their subject so intently with their lens that they sometimes catch fleeting glimpses of their soul.    What if this was how we conversed? What if we talked like we photographed?    I have been obsessed with this notion of conversation for the last few months.  Obsessed with how to approach conversation for a specific purpose, the benefits of conversation, the different forms it takes.    This photography project began with the intention of ""capturing the essence"" of various participants but it's since morphed into something more.    We typically began with coffee/tea, where introductions are made and the project is explained.  After 10-15 minutes of casual conversation, we move the conversation to the photography studio, where I shift ownership of the conversation to the participant.  ""Talk about whatever you want"", I usually tell them. And the exchange that followed has been one of the most powerful, most humbling experiences of my life to date:    In that dim and private studio I have listened to grief. I have listened to pain and suffering and frustration. I have heard ambition and I have heard passion. I have heard happiness and excitement and hope.  The hills and valleys of everyday life. I've met heartbreak and then watched blossoming love chase it away.     There is something so so powerful about an open ear. About someone just willing to listen without judgement. Someone willing to block everything out and completely focus on your life experience for a few moments.   Often times, the participant would open up immediately, with very little effort, as if they had been waiting for the opportunity to share. Other times, participants were a little more hesitant and had their guards up.  The balancing act was trying engage in that beautiful interaction without imposing.    Many times, the room was on the verge of tears.  Many times the room was filled with laughter, echoing out into the halls.  Many times the sessions concluded with hugs and handshakes and the forging of friendships.  Many times the participants would express gratitude for the conversation, knowing little of how humbled I was for being allowed that privilege and how therapeutic it was for me.     I like to think it helped that the participants and I made a conscious effort to approach the conversation at equal level, instead of some sort of saved-savior dynamic.  I was not qualified to provide any sort of solution or feedback to things they discussed, nor did I want to, nor were they necessarily looking for that.  I simply wanted to listen and to be present in that moment. And they simply wanted to talk.      And so I'd like to continue.  I believe we can soothe the suffering, the frustration, the anger, the pain, the sadness that consumes our world today, one person at a time.  One conversation at a time, one photo at a time.      If you or someone you know is interested, get in touch with me through the Contact page and I would be honored to lens you my ear. ",cc,1,0.146,0.085

I'm 18 years old and I'm an idiot, i made a lot of mistake. I'm a shame of a family. I have a brother and tomorrow he will be 25 years old. He living far away from me with his girlfriend in another country and we speak at Messenger. But he don't know my deepest problems. I live with my grandparents because my parents have long since divorced. I'm not talking to my parents.

My ex girlfriend broke up with me at November 2017. Since that I'm going through depression yet I guess. I have very few friends, because I moved to another city when my parents divorced. I made a lot of mistakes. We met and discussed the past a couple of days ago. Everything was okay, I felt like she could be a friend of mine after broke up. On Saturday I was going to the party, she too. And I'm drank a lot. Very lot. I do not remember for this, but she said I tried to beat her and I said she was a bitch. I do not remember anything. They made videos and made pictures of me after I fell. I'm disgrace. I never drank it before.  She blocked me on Facebook, and when we meet random at the station she did not say ""Hi"" or anything. Nothing. She is very important for me.  What I will do: on Thursday:  - I'm going to buy flower for her ( white rose ) - I'm going to her house and apologizing  On Friday: - Impact. - I will end up with killing myself using a plastic bag.

819,"Smartphones (#86) I have mentioned it a few times before, but I'll repeat here--I have a flip phone. I've had it since Oct. 17, 2009 and it has worked well for the past 8+ years. It's called the Alias 2 and [here is what it looks like.](https://imgur.com/a/IAffN) People are usually impressed by the fact that the buttons change depending on how it is flipped. Other than that though, my friends have given me shit for this phone for since probably 2011.   As smartphones became more and more prevalent to the point where it's rare to know anybody who doesn't have one, my phone has become more obsolete. My friends have given my phone many nicknames, include ""the brick"" or ""the toaster.""  I'm able to call, text, and take surprisingly decent quality photos ([example here](https://imgur.com/nbXAO2e)) and that's I really have needed for so long. Sure I can't get group texts or emojis (and honestly, since the IOS 11 update getting texts from iPhones in general sucks) but for the most part I have no issues. If I need to be connected to something I'll use my laptop or my iPod.  However, I'm very aware that my time for owning this phone is coming to an end. Even though the battery life is still fine, the phone has been giving in some ways. I can no longer text when I am at a subway station underground. Sometimes the phone will randomly shut itself off even with a full charge. And for a future full time job (especially since as a dog trainer I'll have to be in contact with clients and stuff) I know I'll need to get a smartphone to do that. Hell, I was looking at job postings recently a couple listed owning a smartphone as a requirement. I also should have access to Uber/Lyft as well and other important things like that which make life easier.  I just don't want a smartphone. I hate how big they are. I hate how confusing they are. I hate how connected to the world I can become no matter where I am. I see it in myself already with just my iPod and laptop if I have wifi, I am constantly on reddit/social media. I don't want to get sucked in even more with no restrictions.   I begrudgingly told my mom that I guess my graduation present should probably be a smartphone even though I don't want one. She knows I wish I could have my flip phone forever but as someone in their early 20s in this time in history, it's nearly impossible to do much without one. She asked which I would want to get, a galaxy like her and my dad, or an iPhone like my brother. And I honestly don't know. While I hate Apple as a company cause they are cheap and don't seem to give a fuck about their consumers, iPhones are so much easier to use. At least in my experience.   So I turn it to all of you to debate what type of smartphone I should get (with actual objective facts).  ^^^^^^^^^^.  ^^^^Trying ^^^^to ^^^^not ^^^^use ^^^^the ^^^^same ^^^^exact ^^^^questions ^^^^I ^^^^used ^^^^in ^^^^my ^^^^22nd ^^^^post ^^^^because ^^^^that ^^^^was ^^^^on ^^^^a ^^^^very ^^^^similar ^^^^topic  In what ways has owning a smartphone benefited you?

825,"My opinions on the Pinocchio Paradox. Hallo. There was this idea I thought of a long time ago that I wanted people's opinion on. It was nothing too big, I just wanted a nice little discussion. However, I put that on rest since I didn't know where exactly I should talk about that. Recently, I came into notice of r/CasualConversation which I found to be a neat little place to talk about random stuff. I thought it would be great to be finally able to share and discuss about this idea. So without further ado, here it is.  If Pinocchio says, ""My nose will now grow."" he would be lying and this will cause the nose of his to grow. However, since his nose grew, he would not be lying and his nose should not grow.   I believe that the answer to this solution is, his nose will grow if Pinnochio says the special statement. This is because the nose only grows if Pinnochio himself is the one who is lying and note that the statement is said before the nose started to grow. His nose only corresponds if he is lying or not; it does not count the actions of itself either. If we count in these two factors, I believe we will have a solid reasoning that the answer to this paradox, will be that his nose will grow.  So er well, what do you think?",cc,1,0.093,0.05

832,"I've finally ditched my iPhone for a Samsung. First of all, I don't want to start an argument here. Each has its own pros and cons, it all comes down to the person whose using it.   I'm normally an Android guy, but switched to an iPhone 6S Plus, 28 months ago, because at the time there weren't any good Android phones in the market (at the time. The phones were either known for overheating (thanks to Snapdragon 808/810), sucky battery life (once again, thanks to the 808/810, and Samsung for putting small batteries on their phones), and has defects (bootlooping, easily bends, etc).   I just wanted a phone without any defects, has good camera, has LTE bands I need for Asia and North America, and something that would last me all day. The iPhone 6S Plus fitted the bill. It served my needs for the last 28 months.  However, I wanted a dual-sim phone, so I would no longer carry two phones, due to greedy carriers here. Besides that, mainly I also miss Android's versatility. You rarely need a computer (to transfer stuff). Also, I switched to an iPhone because they have Apple stores and authorized service center throughout the whole world, so I can have my phone repaired in the same day. But then I realized that we don't have any Apple stores in the country (the Philippines), and there's one service center nearby, and they won't service a phone that wasn't bought locally. Whereas with Samsung, they have a brick and mortar stores, and service centers here.   I decided to trade my iPhone 6S Plus for a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro. A used 6S Plus and a like-new Galaxy J7 pro worth about the same. The camera on the J7 is just as good, also has the LTE bands my iPhone offers, and it has a bigger battery. With those, I don't really miss my 6S Plus. I wanted an S9 Plus, but I can't afford it.  It feels like the weight has been lifted off my shoulder. I no longer need to carry two phones, and I now have versatility of Android, back. Besides, I now have a bigger battery.

938,"Need help.I don't want to kill myself. PLEASE BEAR WITH ME.  So,I'm 21,been facing really hard times since childhood from being bulllied to messed up home enviornment to resigning from my first job within 5 months last year because of same type of toxic people at work.I was still doing okay.But 2 days back we had some glass door repair work at home and called a man who takes work for installing glass door.To give an idea, where I'm from only rowdy people or corrupt politicians could survive,either you yourself have to be a badass asshole type criminal or should know someone who is involved in those type of acti ities ,especially a politician,otherwise there is no justice for a simple/common/mango man. Coming back to that day when the incidemt took place,I'll have to go back to 2 more days back from that day.Before calling in this man, let's call him(Y),we had called someone else to perform the job,let's call him(X).But (X) did not make the glass door as per our expectation and was not responding to our calls afterwards,so I went to his workshop and took back the advance money deposited with him.Now we call (Y),someone who we contacted through another shop nearby our locality.He comes in, took the advance money ,took the reference picture with him, which I had clicked of the glass door which got shaterred which is why we are getting a new one installed.He promised to install it by the next day.Next day he sends his people who were to install it but to our surprise the glass door was exactly the one which was made by(X) and which we had rejected.Upon inquiring with the people who brought it with them,we got to know that it was indeed from the same workshop i.e. (X)'s because they get their work done from X's workshop. After this my mother called that person(Y),to inform about this because it did not match the reference picture we had given him and how he  could send this glass door without even checking it and he started giving round answers and told my mother he will come within half an hour to our place to look at the problem.He then called his people on the phone who were infront of us and called them back and instructed them to leave the glass there itself i.e. our home.After this when again my mother called him to know when he was coming as it was already late ,his tone of talking had already changed and stared saying something rude and started lying,upon which I took the phone and asked him strictly whether he was coming or not and what he would do in this regard,to which he told me he will get a new one installed as per our reference photo.After this he sent his worker to our place to take the other glass door with him for proper size reference and design(mind that glass size is not too big),and we indeed gave it to him in a hope for the satisfactory result.Next day his workers came with the new glass along with the old one they took along with them.But we were shocked when we noticed there was a crack in the old glass which they took for the reference purpose.We immediately called (Y) and he arrived few minutes later and asked his people(workers) whether it was during the time  they were installing the glass cracked to which they replied no.Right after this he started shouting loudly that he isn't going to pay for it,and started behaving really ill mannered way and became aggressive while walking towards my mother,to which I came forward and started shouting on him as well and that went  for several minutes and I don't remember much of what he said bevause I literally was not into my senses,meanwhile my mother kept telling me to calm down and not to stoop to his way of cheap talking.Even then my mother did not raisd her voice and talked to him with patience telling him not to raise his voice as this is someone's home not road.After that I told him to finish that work off and leave that old glass and leave the place.I paid his full amount cause that way he got to know his real value because it was not at all about money,we were really calm while talking and would have had even paid for the glass that cracked due to their mistake.   What really hurt me and kicked my nervousness,anxiety and fear is,after all these years of coping with the bullying I had at school,someone dared to shout and get aggressive in my own home where I thought I was safe.I feel guilty for not being able to protect my mother's dignity and respect because of the way he talked.What if he would have had caused her any harm ,what I would have had done then.I feel powerless,feared and isolated today.The person(Y),had mentioned about working at a property dealer's place nearby our house who has two wives and is involved politically.These are the kind of people due to whom these (Y) type of shameless creatures do crimes in the broad day light.  Now again I have gotten into depression and extreme fear that if in future he becomes powerful(Y) and tries to harm my family in any way,what I will do then because I cannot be sitting at home forever.My mother has suffered for very long in family for different reasons.After he went away I could see her sad although she did say while smiling that don't mind these type of incidents or people and not to get upset about it.But I fear for my mother,family, even myself.Also this incident has literally shaterred my self esteem and confidence that someone really dared to behave that way in my home,took out his frustration and I could not stop him from doing that.Why is these type of things happening with me ,I am lost.What should I do.I don't want to live in fear all my life.There is no rule and law .I don't want to go down the path of becoming a criminal,because I feel that is the only way dealing with these type of people. I have no more motivation left to live.  Please I need answers.",sw,0,0.053,0.092

945,"Accomplishments and lack thereof- let's chat aboot it! So, the one guarantee in life is that there is an end. Everything dies or becomes something else, so, might as well enjoy what you are when you're it. While alive, I have things I have accomplished and things I probably never will. Some personal achievements and wild aspirations of mine include:  -Wasted more money I will ever make on ""higher education"" only to learn that I learned no skills and was primed for nothing in the real world. If someone is thinking about going to college/university for the arts, try first without wasting the money.  -Got married though I was convinced I would never do something so contractually obligating in my life. Turns out, love is real and also really lovely. WARNING: change is a requirement. Love is fraught with adaptability, in the most delightful ways.  -I've always wanted to be famous. Not rich, just known. Not known for something, just acknowledged. I know I will die without achieving fame or anything close to it. I have come to terms with the fact that it would require me being someone I am not. Still- I could make a lot of people smile like some celebrities do.  -Worldbuilding and the challenges of creating something from nothing with an imaginative yet chaotic brain. Most people who create things on Earth are highly creative people or highly intelligent, or both. I am neither intelligent nor creative but instead am uncontrollably imaginative. With that came Topia, a board game concept I am creating where the game plays itself and can even be played solo. The Topian universe lacks Earth's ultimate guarantee of death and even lacks humans. It's a great place for me to play and know there is no one else involved in it.    Other than that, pretty basic life of struggling against the human conditions and ultimately accepting I am but a cog. A poor cog with a rich imagination.

I was doing spring cleaning around the house when my dad started yelling and raising his fists at me for not doing things quickly enough. I locked myself in my room and barricaded the door. He yelled at me ""I'm gonna kick the door in!"" and I heard him say to my mom ""One day I'm gonna murder that girl!"". It was all too much so I let the mood die down they called me out for dinner so I came out. They expected me to apologize for locking my door and said it's my fault for being scared and always wanting to kill myself. I couldn't take it anymore I grabbed my fork and started stabbing myself. After that, I ran right back into my room and barricaded the door. For the past 2 years, I've been managing my depression and anxiety. I've been in college full time, been living with my parents, and I have a loving boyfriend. I've been having panic attacks from nothing and when I drive home my brain puts thoughts of cutting myself and letting myself bleed out onto the pages of my coloring books. These thoughts are so vivid I can feel my wrists burn in pain. I've never cut myself before but I do keep a kitchen knife in my bedroom. I've been saying goodbye more and more. I just don't want to be causing anyone including myself any more pain. I think I could die peacefully knowing that the only pain left to cause is the pain of losing me. I feel guilty and ashamed I haven't done anything with my life. I called the helpline and my counselor. I'm not on any medications. I'm just so tired and helpless I don't want to do anything with my life except throw it away. I'm tired of being told to look on the bright side and to practice self-compassion and self-awareness. I don't think anyone can help me but I'm too scared to die. Maybe I wanna have someone push me outta a window. I don't really know what I want.

Overall it was good, and I don’t remember ever wanting to die as a child. I dropped out of highschool and went to college, college didn’t work out it lasted a few years til I dropped out again. Now I have zero qualifications. I feel useless for society sitting at home doing absolutely nothing. Parents are divorced. I’ve never had a good healthy relationship with either of my parents. They constantly show they’re not interested in understanding my depression and I’m always arguing with them. I have alot of emotional pain from the bad relationship I’ve had with my parents. I don’t feel I belong in my family because I always put emotions first, and nobody in my family does that. I feel completely out of place and lonely.   I’ve been to counselling on and off for many years and I’ve tried medication. I’m currently talking to my psychologist once a week and I constantly lie to her about the suicidal thinking because I don’t want anyone to interfere when I do it. I say I don’t think about killing myself when all I think about is killing myself. I want it to be permanent. I’ve cut all ties with all of my friends. It broke my heart to have to distance myself from friends who have been there for me and listened when I needed a kind ear.   I have no hobbies/purpose.

It was at this time I also found my first girlfriend, and things were somewhat good, there was good and bad as there are in every relationship but I broke up with her a bit after a year together and it hurt for the longest of times but I see that she’s moved on and she’s happy now and that’s enough reason for me to move on and leave her to be happy. This was the last two years of my life. No longer in university but have applied again and gotten in. I’ve tried working but the job I had I couldn’t handle the pressure and I would find myself becoming more suicidal because it wasn’t what I wanted to do and working for money alone wasn’t going to make me happy. I met another girl I was infatuated with but things wasn’t meant to be and a lot was said confusing me in the process and adding to my self doubt and hatred.   Since the time my dad has died I’ve seen 8 therapists, ranging from counsellor to psychiatrists, I’ve also tried meditation and cbt and I’m just as broken as ever ",sw,0,0.067,0.182
1053,"Please help Hi, my names Jessica, im 15, and since probably mid middle school ive been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, extreme depression, social anxiety, insomnia, bipolar, pretty much everything under the sun. Ive always been kind of a loser. I was always a bit of a bigger kid, an outcast, i had barely any friends and even then those friends were horrible and often times put me down. Ive dealt with gender and sexuality issues. Ive already been to a crisis center once. I lost an amazing friend i had due to emotional manipulation i hadnt realized i had been dishing out because of my paranoia, been called crazy by both her and her mom and now a lot of people at school are even worse to me then they were before. My mental illnesses have been painted off as attention seeking, my thoughts of suicide are now just attempts to ""drag people down."" I hate it, i hate living at this point and im too pathetic to commit suicide because im scared of the pain and im scared that i might have a good future but i still want to go get a gun from my dads room and shoot myself. Im so close to it, im tired of being sad and crying every day and feeling absolutely worthless. I feel literally completely numb like someones sucked every ounce of happiness out of my life. Ive never had someone comfort me, ive been alone with this for so long and i feel like im going to snap. No medicine has been working, ive been on 5 different psychiatric meds.

1057,"Need help writing a song. I'm looking for a modern day variation of the classic adage ""like a moth to a flame"". Basically, if you're unfamiliar, moths/bugs are attracted to flames for whatever reason. They're attracted to something that can kill them. Anyone know any variations on this old saying?  I'm asking because I'm writing a pop song with this theme, and I want the chorus to be a variation on this similie. I normally just write everything myself, but I'm having trouble getting this song's lyrics finalized. The general vibe of the song is essentially ""it's a sick joke that I can't let you go after you keep letting me down... like why do I keep coming back...wtf is wrong with me... why can't I just drop you"" and I'm kind of half laughing, half crying about it. I'm arguing with myself essentially. I'm simultaneously aware of how irrational I'm being, but I still can't help myself.  The right metaphor will become the chorus/song title and can really make or break the song. If I use your idea I'll give you a writing credit if you want one (bookmark me, this account ain't going anywhere).  Right now the song has a futuristic feel. There's a talkbox in the chorus, and some funk guitar. There's also some wah-wah synths. Lots of harmonies and layers to the vocals. It's just really funky and dancey. The verses are pretty much done, I just keep tweaking the lyrics a bit.  Just figured I'd try Reddit in case y'all have any ideas here. Not expecting anything of course. Thank you!",cc,1,0.118,0.1

I've been lurking this subreddit for a while and have never made a post but you all seem nice and reasonable people so I'd like to ask for some advice!  At my friend's job there is a 8am-5pm position with weekends off that pays $17/hr but it's far from where I live so I would have to commute 2+ hours a day.

The new job has possibilities of getting a promotion while at my current job there is absolutely none.  Having my current job gives me time to go to the gym and relax at home after work.

So today I went to a store nearby to buy some stuff, coke and milk and cookies and coated peanuts and things like that. When I got to the check out there were like six people queued, which is pretty impressive for such a small store. The cashier was a pretty and hard-working young woman, and she was doing her best to get all the items quickly so that people don't have to wait for long. Apparently she was working alone at that time.  I was the last customer in the line, but a young guy before me said, ""You go first, sir, I gotta get some other stuff."" I went before him and the girl immediately said her usual ""Welcome to our store!"" and started checking my stuff out. She enthusiastically asked whether I was interested in buying any of the things that were on sale today, with samples stacked right next to her, and I gladly picked some pudding. She said ""Thank you!"" and I replied ""Thank *you*"" with a smile.   And then she said something right out of the blue. ""Haven't seen you in a few days. Is it that you hadn't come here, or is it that I wasn't here when you did come?"" I was stumped. I didn't know what to say, so I just said, ""Really? I was here yesterday..."" (which I can't really remember.) And she replied, ""Yes I know you came here yesterday, but I mean before that, you know I haven't seen you in like four or five days.""

I'm mainly thinking back to 2005-2007ish times when the internet was becoming more of the 'thing' it exists as today, and idk man. It just seemed like there were so many different subcommunities and online groups/sites with their own flair, culture, inside jokes, and overall so much bright silliness and creativity (not that there wasn't lots of bad things, trolls, etc. etc.). Now it feels like there's just some 'big' websites that feel more or less the same, and maybe really small interest-specific blogs or pages on top of those.   For me being on the internet (recreationally) used to feel so much more exciting, like you were always discovering new sites or communities or memes or whatever. And more than that it was almost secretive(?), or I guess people never talked about much internet going-ons or memes irl. Now, with phones and social media like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit tbh the 'real' and 'online' worlds have more or less merged, or at least finding the divide is much more difficult.    IDK, like I said, this is all pretty much me just being nostalgic over my childhood and making 2006 internet sound much more special and amazing than it actually was.

1143,"My Experience Being Suicidal I developed my depression when my social anxiety got out of control. All my life, I've struggled with anxiety. Even back when I  was extremely young, I struggled to make friends and attend a public school. My anxiety got so bad to the point where it made me physically sick, and I'd usually end up vomiting every morning. I lost immense amounts of weight this way.  One high school hit, it developed out of control. Being in a school with over 3000 other teenagers was too much for me to bear. I got sick every day, I missed classes and eventually just couldn't show up.  My doctor told me the best option for me was to go on a hospital homebound program until my anxiety was under control. I started on new medications and meeting with new therapists. Many of which helped me for quite awhile.  When I left public school, I lost contact with most of my friends. I felt isolated from my family, my friends, and those whom I cared deeply about. Both my parents worked all day and came home late, my mother was also an alcoholic and drug abuser at the time, even though I didn't know it, and my older brother wanted nothing to do with me. I was alone, all day, every day.  Eventually, I felt so isolated, alone and sad for so long that I couldn't remember whom I once was. I couldn't remember a time where I didn't feel sad, I forgot how I used to act. The things I once enjoyed doing no longer brought me happiness.   I stopped caring about everything. My grades slowly starting slipping, as I was not motivated and didn't care enough to worry about them.  I planned to end my life.  I was a disappointment to my parents. I never felt like I was enough, I would end up starving myself to be skinnier and occasionally throwing up my meals because I worried about gaining weight. I felt as if I had no one, I was alone. I cut myself.  What was the point in living if you can't share a life with others? What was the point in living if you were always alone, always living a life on repeat, never feeling any different?  I cried until there were no tears left, until I was numb. I had watched a movie about a girl who attempted suicide one day when I was alone. That day, I planned to kill myself. I cried and my nose bled, but I didn't bother dealing with it. I sat in a puddle of my own blood and stared at a wall for what felt like hours. I was so mind-numbingly afraid. I said goodbye to the one person who seemed to care about me, the girl who to this day I owe everything to. She begged me not to do it. She called me and messaged me begging me not to go.  I had a handful of prescription pills, and I put them in my mouth. I had researched earlier to see how much I needed to kill myself, and I had the right amount. I held those pills in my mouth, covered in my own blood, shaking, crying and screaming while my friend was messaging and calling me like crazy.   I ended up swallowing some of the pills, not enough to kill myself though. I pushed myself to get up and clean myself up. If I couldn't continue living for myself, I have to continue living for her. I cleaned everything up and once everyone came home that night, it was if nothing happened.  I still feel the urge constantly to end my own life. I still don't know who I am or who I used to be. I'm still alone and isolated. I still cut myself. I'm still hurting and scared, but I'm still here. I'm not too sure why, either.

Starting off I'll give a bit of context and backstory to the situation. We started dating a year ago and while she had depression then she was high functioning and her risk assessment was very low (I have training in risk assessment and prevention) however, after a while she had to move a good distance away for post-secondary. It was around this time she started to degrade. I made it a point to visit her as often as I could (about once a week for a weekend) as my job allowed it. I recently lost my job and moved down to be with her, initially I hoped that that would help her but it seemed to have to opposite effect. Recently I got a new job and have been working longer hours. Tonight I came home to her in the worst of her episodes to date. She shut me out of our room and broke down. I've been trying to get her to agree to go see a professional but she insists that doing so gives her depression power and that she wants to die. Her risk assessment was vastly worse that when I had previously done it and to be honest I'm running out of ideas. My biggest fear is coming home to find that she's hurt herself or worse. I need help. ",sw,0,0.079,0.215

1157,"I got a job! I'm super excited and don't have anyone to share in it with, so Reddit you're gonna get my stream of consciousness.  I've trying for months to get a better job, and after a week of interviews I finally got an offer making nearly twice my current salary!  For the past 18 months I've been working as the General Manager and sole bread baker (crusty sourdough, the kind of old world bread takes 3 days to make) in a small but busy cafe/panini restaurant. It is severely understaffed, to the point where often times during the morning commute rush I am the only employee and have to take orders, brew coffees, make espresso drinks (decades old Italian machine, not a single automated aspect), make and run sandwiches/salads, prep the food, and mix/shape/bake bread. Then also squeeze in inventory/ordering, scheduling, cash management/reports, dishes (entirely hand washed, no machine), janitorial work, etc. You get the idea.  When I took the job initially I had just found out my wife cheated on me and we were divorcing. It was Thanksgiving and I was in a low place. I allowed my current bosses to take advantage of me and agreed to a year long contract before I agreed to a pay. It was only supposed to be for making bread, nothing else. I was hired specifically for my French bread experience. They had previously only been making super sweet spongy type breads (and not very good quality ones IMHO, but I know I'm a snob). I was desperate, moving to a new state, and this job initially seemed like it would be less stressful.  I've never made much money. I used to work in office administration/bookkeeping, but when the 2008 market made me lose my job I decided to go to culinary school so I could at least enjoy what I did at work. I chose to work in kitchens that couldn't pay well, but either looked good on my resume or were places I could learn new techniques.   The owners told me they think my salary of $27,500 is 'more than fair'. As recently as last week they told me they expect me to work 12 hour days if need be to save on labor costs.  I started looking for a new job 6 months ago, but nothing seemed like a good fit. Most kitchens tend to run high with testosterone, and I'm not about that. Or they demand 50-60+ hour work weeks that break your back, and I'm getting too old for that. Good bread bakeries are few and far between. And it's really hard to find time to job hunt while working a full time job that is actually causing you to go further into debt.   I'm in debt up to my eyeballs. My bank account is empty. I'm divorced. I've lost contact with most all of my friends from before I was married. But right now, I couldn't be happier. I've got my two kittens and In two weeks I'll start  making more money than I ever have before. And it'll be the first place in a while I will be proud to tell people I work at.

Am sitting alone after having just had a really good phone interview (they offered me the job on the spot) and just wanted to share both my happiness and tips on what helped me so it might help anyone else who might be in a similar situation.  I spent about 3-4 hours before the interview doing preparations.  I got 5 sheets of paper and put bold titles on the top of each: 1. About the organization and where the role fits in, 2. Duties and Accountabilities, 3. Selection Criteria, 4. Other Practical Examples, and 5. My Questions.  I then filled in information in my best handwriting on each sheet.  I used a notepad for scribbling down rough notes for each on a separate paper.  But the important thing was that I eventually wrote the good notes down by hand.  This because I read something about the learning process that things sink into your memory better when you write them by hand rather than type.  For the sheet 1. I bullet pointed everything relevant I could find in the job description / website, writing key words in red.  For sheets 2 and 3 (duties and selection criteria) I put what was listed in the job description bullet pointed down the left side of the paper (again highlighting key words) and then wrote how I fit each point with practical examples on the right side.  For sheet 4 I brainstormed other practical examples of topics that I guessed would probably come up in interview questions, like “common problems” and “innovations”, etc.  For sheet 5 I listed the questions I had.  I had all 5 sheets laid out in front of me (along with my CV and covering letter) when the phone interview started.

For instance, I'm over a white male over 50, with low career success, numerous setbacks, and low ability to cope with stressful life events.  Other factors also point to an elevated risk of a successful suicide. I often feel a thwarted sense of belonging. In psychological testing, I score low on Openness to Experience (OTE) and high in Neuroticism. My reaction to stressful events is rigid and uncreative, often exacerbating the problems I'm trying to address. I see myself as a burden to others. I live alone, and I have never had a partner for longer than four months. Those relationships have been few, and years apart. I do not have many confidantes, and none nearby. I spend most of my days alone, and I rarely have the desire to go out.   I don't plan on commiting suicide tonight or the next, but I doubt I'll live past my 50s.

Please feel free to AUA (ask us anything) over the next few days, we'll be happy to answer :)  Be warned: This is going to be an ENORMOUS post (pushing 5,500 characters).  **HysteriacTheSecond**: Salut! I'm /u/HysteriacTheSecond (although perhaps that part is redundant since my username is provided anyway), or Emily for short. Feel free to call me anything, though; I really don't mind! \^_\^ Other little tidbits: I'm from a little village in the north of England, and I'm likely one of the younger moderators here at age seventeen.  I really am so excited to be a part of the community here at /r/CasualConversation. I've always seen this subreddit as a great bastion for a combination of the wholesome and friendly nature for which all subreddits should strive with the great size that makes such an achievement often nearly impossible. I, of course, know that this is partly down to the fantastic work put into the subreddit by the moderation team, and to be able to help the team with this goal is something about which I am incredibly proud.  My passions often rest within the avant-garde: I adore delving into all that is 'out-there' in the arts, from James Joyce (favourite: *Finnegan's Wake*) in literature, to David Lynch (favourite: *Inland Empire* / *Mulholland Drive* / *Twin Peaks: The Return* / [Oh gosh I have no idea](https://imgur.com/a/grlhL)) in film, to Autechre (favourite: *Chiastic Slide*) in music, to Francis Bacon (favourite: *Pope I*) in fine art. Bar the arts, I also adore philosophy; catching up with the Nintendo Switch's first year; playing Dungeons & Dragons, among other board games; staring at pictures of buns (preferably [king buns](https://xkcd.com/1682/) but I'm not fussy); and spreadsheets.  :-)  **SoapyTheBum**: Howdy! I'm SoapyTheBum, you can just call me Soapy. I live in New York, right in the suburbs of the city.  I'm so happy to be part of this community because of how much I really enjoy being here and engaging with all of the other people who are just looking to shoot the breeze. The relaxed atmosphere, the friendly mood, the encouraging responses all come together to create just a wonderful community that I'm not only glad to be part of, but also proud to be part of.  While I have a lot of hobbies, the ones that I seem to talk the most about are cooking and reading, and I'm always willing to talk about either those things, as well as any other topic that I'm either familiar with or interested in.  Other hobbies that I enjoy are: board games, dungeons and dragons, video games, and pop culture, and music.  **Lousy_Try_Brian**: Hey, everyone! My name isn't really Brian (I'm actually a woman!) so you can call me Lousy. :) I'm so excited to join the team!  I love r/CasualConversation because it embodies the best of the internet: a place where strangers from all over the world can share in pleasant conversation without the usual trolling, hostility, and other ugliness that creeps in so easily. I am so grateful to have a chance to join the mods and contribute to this awesome sub!  I'm from the great, if misunderstood, state of Utah in the USA. I'm in my 30s, so I think I may be one of the older mods. I work as a technical writer by day, and in my free time I love to bake delicious things, read interesting books, and spend time with my family. I'm looking forward to seeing you all around the sub!  **Mel_Pond**: Howdy y'all! My name is Mel, or Melody, or even River Song if you want (Yes, it's definitely a Doctor Who reference). I've always loved the strong sense of community in the sub and I'm insanely happy to give back however I can! I'm definitely the youngest of the mod team, and I'm also a fairly artistic individual. I look forward to the next few months!  **Love_The_Heat**: Hi everyone. New guy. A quick blurb about myself?  It all started when my life was flipped and turned upside down. I was born and raised in Philadelphia where I spent a lot of time at this local playground where we mostly chilled, relaxed, and shot basketball.  One day these no good guys started trouble and we got in a fight. It was crazy actually. One guy picked me up and swung me around in a circle on his shoulders. I bet it looked crazy from above. Anyways, my mom got scared and sent me to Cali to live with my Aunt and Uncle. It's about 7 or 8 right now as I write this and I can't believe that I'm finally here with ye as the new Prince of CC.  My neck hurts, but nice to meet you!  **MattsOutrageous**: Hey guys! My name is Matt. you can also call me Adam (my middle name) if you prefer :) I'm based in the UK so I guess I'll be taking the morning shift ;)  I'm so happy to be a part of r/CasualConversation because I absolutely love the community here. Everyone seems to be invested in others and supportive, caring, kind... You're all fantastic. Above all, y'all know how to have a conversation, casually.  I'm definitely not the youngest in the mod team at 24 years old, but I don't think I'm the oldest either!  I'm a huge fan of video games.

The terms of my parole (12 months of parole due to my criminal conviction) state that I must seek psychological help. I've been there and done that. Psychologists are useless. I've begun seeing my old psychiatrist after a year of not seeing him. I hope I'll be able to use my ADHD condition to get back on Ritalin. (I was on it during high school and it made studying and life so much easier. Since I got off it, my life has gone downhill.)   I recognize that I need help. I come from a very well off family, and my parents have the attitude that money can solve everything. And they were right. I have a speech impediment, and chucking money at a speech therapist solved the problem. My poor grades in the first few years of high school were solved by chucking money at a private tutor. My ADHD was solved by chucking money at a psychiatrist and at Ritalin. With my parent's attitude, I feel I cannot get help from them.   What people don't  know is I've attempted suicide before. Thankfully a dog walker saw me throwing the noose around a tree to hang myself and tackled me. I ran off before he could call the police.   In my opinion, to get my life back on track, I must: (1) get back on Ritalin (this will become a reality next month); (2) get a real social life and start associating with people; and (3) stop being a mong (I can laugh about it now, but sometimes I feel like ending my life).

1259,"I finally bought a new laptop but not so sure how I feel about it My current laptop is over 5 1/2 years old. It was an expensive gamer laptop so it can still run many games on high settings (except for the most demanding ones). The laptop is technically still usable, and I probably will continue to use it to play games that are currently installed on it. However, it still has Windows 7 which will be phased out soon (don't get me started on trying to upgrade it to 10), it loads things super slowly, and the hard drive sometimes seems to mysteriously fill up without me doing anything (I get the low disk space prompt all the time). A couple years ago I had to go through the whole process of reformatting my laptop because it crapped out and wouldn't even boot Windows.  Still, I'm the type of person that hates to buy a newer model unless the older model isn't even usable anymore. Same thing for my phone and for my car - I didn't buy a new one until I literally had to tow my car to the dealership for engine overheating (among other things). I guess the reason why I bought a new laptop now is so I could be proactive about transferring to a new computer so it won't be as much of a hassle later on (and I'm getting tired of dealing with my current one), but there's still a part of me that feels like I should still try to squeeze as much out of my current laptop as I can, lol.  Anyone else feel this way about buying new stuff? How do you justify your purchases?

1264,"I turn 32 tomorrow and my life is pointless I’ve reached a point that I see nothing in the future I wish to enjoy. Everything seems utterly pointless. I quit my job at the end of 2016, traveled all over the US for most of the year and even went overseas multiple times for volunteer work and pleasure. I’ve done things this past year that other people dream of doing, yet I am completely jaded. I’ve struggled with depression my entire life, but since August 2016 it’s been worse than ever before and I don’t know how to get out of this hole, or even why I would.  My wife of eight years told me in August 2016 she wasn't in love with me anymore, ends up she had started sleeping with a guy from her work, who she's now living with. Lot's of crazy things happened with her from August until July last year, when she finally moved and never spoke to me again. We’re still technically married, but zero contact in almost a year... well rejection hurts. I know that was where a lot of my depression still stems from, but this feeling that life is pointless feels impossible to shake. During the split from my wife, I basically let her have everything but one of our vehicles, some clothes, and camping gear and I hit the road. I went to 26 National Parks, did crazy hikes, spent two months surfing on the coast in Oregon, loads of snowshoeing and snowboarding, etc. but I also suffer(ed)really bad from insomnia and spent countless nights weeping in my car. Days without eating or sleeping caused my weight to drop and I’ve been hovering around 160, down from my 2016 weight of 220(an at first welcome to my depression, but I’ve now seen as unhealthy).  I had been told I should volunteer to get out of this funk, so I went to Ghana Africa for two months to assist in building an orphanage(I'd done this a few times before in other countries)and I didn't care. I did the work I went to do, I played with kids, etc, but I didn't care and was left cold. I've been back in the states for six months now. Traveling again around the US often. I was told to get a different hobby besides hiking and traveling alone, so I started taking ceramics again at a local craft guild as I majored in ceramic arts in college, but that too hasn’t lifted this cloud. I’ve been told to try to date again and I’ve seen women and slept with them, but I’m not attracted to anyone and my sex drive has bottomed out. I know a lot of this must sound crazy, but I worked to be able to experience a lot and always said yes. Now I look back and I don't know what it was exactly I was working for or why I did so much? There's little I look back on and care to remember. I recognize I should be grateful for what I have, the friends I have, and experiences I have, but I'm not and I feel guilt and shame for that, which causes me to close up even more. I’m currently taking Zolpidem and Trazodone and they aren’t helping at all. I use marijuana frequently to try and feel something, it at least gives me an appetite, but that’s about it. I’ve had the epiphanies at different times that things are going to turn around.  A few weeks ago I was in Death Valley NP, standing at the lowest point in North America and thought out loud that the only direction from here was up! And felt good for a moment, but that moment was so fleeting and felt fake afterwards.   I’m 32.  I have friends that care about me.  I have a family that loves me. I have experiences others dream about. And it all feels like nothing.  My father in law committed suicide during my first year of marriage, along with one of my best friends in high school. I recognize it’s the “easy” way out, I just don’t think I can take this hard path any longer. I’m tired. People know I’m tired. I feel like I’m pathetic when I’m around anyone, like I should be over things, moving on with my life, but it’s like a pause button was pressed and I’m supposed to suffer here.  I don’t know what else to say. ",sw,0,0.093,0.133
1265,"Emails (#94) ^^^^I ^^^^think ^^^^this ^^^^is ^^^^the ^^^^shortest ^^^^time ^^^^between ^^^^two ^^^^posts ^^^^I've ^^^^had ^^^^so ^^^^far  Prior to the end of of the spring 2017 semester, I was always on top of all my emails. I hated seeing the little red number notification on my email icon on my laptop or my old iPod touch. As soon as I would get an email from someone, I would reply. I was always very diligent with keeping up with everything.  Then I had to start thinking about my capstone and I had to be in contact with my capstone mentor but that (still to this day when my draft is due tomorrow) felt too overwhelming so I pushed it off and started checking my emails less and less. When I got my new iPod Touch I even deleted the email app from it because I didn't want the constant reminders of my laziness. When I turned on my laptop for the first three years of college I would open the email app and the internet browser as soon as my laptop turned on. Now I haven't opened my email app in months because I'm afraid of the scolding emails saying I should be doing this or that. I still check my emails in the web browser occasionally. I just checked and I have 54 unread emails in my personal email and 29 unread in my college email. That's a lot for me. Most of them are things I consider spam that really aren't, and only one or two are things I should actually care about. When I am done stressing about my school work and being reprimanded for not doing well I do plan on getting back into my habit of checking my emails religiously like in the past.   I never understood how people could just let unread (or even read emails) pile up to the thousands. I had a friend with over 20,000 unread emails. For me, I read the emails, reply if necessary, and then delete them from my inbox if they aren't important enough to keep. Some I'll save into other folders or just keep in my inbox until after a specific date. Every now and then I'll clear out my deleted emails folder and my other folders as well when things are no longer needed in my life.   I hate getting the automatic list-server emails from companies after buying something from them or signing up for some other service on their website. I also hate getting spam after spam from organizations repeatedly when I don't even know how I got on their list to begin with. I have no idea how many email lists I've unsubscribed from over the years. At some point I was getting so much spam in my inbox it took over the emails I needed to get. The only organization I wont unsubscribe from is the company that took my high school graduation photos. They'll still email me once every couple of months asking me to buy the photos even though I graduated in 2014.  When I was around middle school, even though there was AIM, Facebook, and texting, my main way of keeping in contact with a lot of people was via email. Even my grandma! I still have a very small handful of those old emails saved and I wish I had more just so I could look back and see what stupid shit my friends and I would share with each other that seemed so important at 11 years old.   When I m working in the office I have an email relating to the theater that I keep very organized. I didn't set up this email since I wasn't the first assistant my manager has had, so there are tons of emails from before I started working in the office. When I first started there were a large amount of unread emails (over 700) and lots of useless emails in the inbox. I asked my manager if I could go through them and delete what was no longer needed. She showed me which types of emails I should keep and what weren't necessary anymore so I went through all of them until it was all nice and neat. Only a few months ago did it dawn on my to make separate folders for the old emails. Now I have a folder for all the emails before my time, and folders for each six month contract since the older emails aren't important unless the client returns to the theater. Also with this email I do not check it at all unless I am in the office and getting paid. My manager has realized this and, despite her workaholic personality, has accepted that I wont reply to anything when I am not in the office. If something is urgent she'll either text me and email my personal email. I didn't do this so much when I first started working in the office and I felt some of the stress from work carry me home but once I took a hard stance with this approach, things got better.  How many unread emails do you have?  Are there any organizations you get automatic emails from that you don't bother unsubscribing from?  Do you organize your emails in different folders or just let everything sit in your inbox?  Did you ever actually send those old chain emails out to people?

I then sorted things out with her and everything was great which I updated on.  Now we are taking kind of a break because yet again I cannot be a good person. I always just do shit my own way without thinking of her feelings and opinions.  We have been talking all day and she says she loves me still but she is not sure if she can believe that I can be that person again. I had already promised her this but I just took her for granted.  We had an abortion a few months ago which I was always for but I did say it was her choice. We had it but she told me how much she regretted it after and I do too as I know we would be a happy family by now and would be getting married in one month.  Now all of that is gone or in doubt and I have nothing to show for my life.  I just want to end it but I am also scared to end it. I live near a large bridge that connects Wales and England so it is always an option for me but I don't know what is left for me in life if we end.

1282,"Writing Feedback? So, I went to the Chicago Art museum today, and in It, I saw a sculpture of a woman who accidentally killed herself through her own stupidity on her wedding day. So, a 'tragic hero', but what if the tragedy was not an accident? It's a bit inspired this myth, some Taming of the Shrew/12 Things I hate about you, and some of Remus & Romulus (Myth of the founding of Rome)     “You should do it sister, it will be fun” The sister of the bride encouraged, opening the chest at the foot of the bed. The bride gave a soft smile, and sat down in it. Her husband was downstairs, draining drinks at the reception. He loved surprises, right? She was sure, and she bent over, wrapping her arms around her upper legs. Her splitting image closed the lid of the chest, the iron hasp on the front locking it loosley. ‘Fool’ she thought to herself, as she draped the cover back over the chest. Then she put the heavy iron lock pin through the hasp, sealing one of their fates.  Somewhere along the line, she had been labeled as dumb. It was far from the truth. She had earned the label because she did not listen, and questioned authority. She was sharp as a razor, and cunning as a wolf. Her sister was an obedient and empty headed sheep. However, the sheep was the one who had hours earlier married the son of a rich nobleman. She was set to go to a nunnery.   “Remember, don’t make a sound, or the surprise will be lost” the wolf said, blowing out one of the candles, then the other, and then taking the third with her. She closed the door, and went down to the reception. At the head table was her mother, her father, the parents of the groom, and the groom. Her sister's seat was not the only one empty, but she took it.   It was actions like these that caused the negative connotations around her. Everyone knew the finances of the wedding. While they were not poor, they were not rich either. There was good money and many promises made for a hand in marriage. Just not hers.     What do you think?

1296,"I sexually committed a crime and I can’t get over it. Let me start out by saying that I came on here for support and to see what I actually did was wrong. I 100% feel like what I did was wrong, but I want other people’s opinions as well. I’m scared to tell my friends about this or even a therapist, so I decided to go on here to see if I could get some advice. Could be bad, but it’s worth a shot. I’m running out of options.  A little backstory, I’m 19, and I recently dated this girl that I used to go to school with. She moved back into town and we started talking again. Right away, I knew she was into me because she kept on dropping hints about my looks and all that. I figured, what the hell, I’ll go out with her. She is my type anyways. So we started dating and we took things at a very fast pace, which I was nervous about, but she assured me that everything was fine.   It was my birthday the next day, and she wanted me to come over and spend the night with her. I said no at first, due to the fact that it was 11 at night and I just wanted to go home and sleep. But eventually I gave in. I drove over there and we started to lay in bed and talk. I don’t know why I got so horny, but I did. So I wanted to get rid of it. With my girlfriend being right there and us already doing sexual stuff (dating for a month btw. This is the fast paced part I mentioned), I wanted to have sex. She said she wasn’t in the mood. So I went down a notch and asked her to talk dirty to me. She laughed at that fact and said no. I kept on asking her, joking with her, and eventually she gave me. I do my thing, clean up, and we talk afterwards and then sleep.   The next day, we get dressed and I leave her apartment. Throughout the day, we’re talking and then she says that she’s in big trouble. Said that something went down with her grandparents and that she is screwed. We didn’t talk for a day, so I got worried and asked her the next day if she was okay. She responded and confronted me about my sexual assault.   I first, I was shocked that I could do such a thing. I thought nothing of it, but as she told me and made me remember, it hit me like a brick wall. I started to ball my eyes out. I told my mom about what happened and she tried to reassure me that it was just a huge misunderstanding, but I knew what I did was wrong.  I apologized and everything to her. We eventually broke up and it still dawns on me everyday of what I did.   I’ve done some recent research on this topic and see what I can do to get some help for myself as I don’t want to be the same person that I am. I also see if this was an actual crime or not. Judging from what I read, it seems like it could be to me, but again, want peoples opinions on this one.   I posted it on here mostly because I saw a similar one on here and I want to die over this. I feel absolutely distraught and disgusted over myself for this.   Any advice you guys have will help me a lot, as I’m stuck at a crossroads and don’t know what to do. Thanks ",sw,0,0.089,0.121

1315,"I miss flash games. I play games on my phone a lot. But ""play games"" seems to mean ""play games for a couple of days then delete them"". The only game I've really stuck with on my phone for the past several months is Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links, which kind of brings me to my problem. On mobile, I see lots of very ""small"" games. Ketchapp's games are a good example of this. They're the sort of thing that make flappy Bird look only slightly uncomplicated. But the graphics are charming, and the gameplay is tight and fun. There were lots of flash games like that. I have fond memories of that game where you drove your armored vehicle around, hit things, then bounced on things. It's hard writing something with examples when you can't even remember their names.   But the other type of mobile game I see is very large games. Maybe not large in terms of complexity; I don't think anyone is going to put their score at Game of War on their résumé, unless they're trying to prove they're already rich and don't need the job they're applying for as some odd negotiation tactic. These games are the ones with timers, energy (although plain old energy seems to kind of be a relic of the days of Facebook games), and Reddit's dreaded in-app purchases. Honestly, I'm not that against in-app purchases. For most games, they really feel like paying for cheat codes which some people are against, but I never used cheat codes outside of the GTA series so it doesn't really affect me too much.   However, these games are kind of infamous for making you want to do well in the game (because, well, that's the point of a game usually) and making that only possible if you can outspend your rivals. But I'm not even going to complain about that. What I'm mad about is that all those games have flooded the market and they're all so similar, competing for your time and money. Even if I had all the time in the world, I only have the patience for one or two of those games. I see all these high download count games and think to myself ""Why are they playing Clash of Warchiefs when they can be playing Battle of Valor?"". But that's what I miss about flash games. There were so many that were right in the middle when it came to how much time they expected from you. Roguelites, RPGs that are short by RPG standards, strategy games, Things that you could play a lot, or just a little of. Of course those still exist on mobile, but a lot of times they cost money (although not really a problem with Google's refund policy) and I have a lot of trouble finding them. With flash games I could just go to the highest rated games on Kongregate, Armor Games and Newgrounds and there's be good stuff.   TL;DR: there are a lot of really small arcade games of mobile and there are a lot of MMO Style Games That demand all your attention. I wish there were more medium sized games like flash games often were.  What do you think about flash games and mobile games?  ... Is that enough for automod?",cc,1,0.123,0.071

It wasn't clear in my department what my tasks should be, so I discussed it again with my superior and we came to a common solution.

The reason why I'm commiting suicide really isn't selfish or anything. I'm just in a lot of pain. I was hit by a car 7 yrs ago and havent been the same since. My head always hurts. Like a lot. Its so bad theres no relief in sight. I really don't know what has prevented me from commiting suicide till now. I wanted to before but was too scared. But now I have nothing to lose no family no friends no opportunity to ger better. I've tried it all and meds only make things worse. The times I'm not in pain my head just feels empty. Its unbearable and AlI cant function. I just lay around all day like a vegetable pushing through the pain. I sometimes have bad panic attacks or bad pain throughout the body I think its a type of fibromyalgia. I cant even watcha movie in piece. I always feel rushed and even this message I don't even know what ai wrote I just have a short attention span. I most likely have some sort of brain damage. If its any comfort I'm dying from hep c ina year anyways so I'm saving me the pain. I'm just writing it here because I know my parents will send me to a psyche ward where ill be put on meds that make the pain worse. If you do call the cops ill definately do it. Ill probably be a pusyy and sis out since i fear the pills will just add to the damage and inwont die. Like I don't even want to die. I love life and being with people and my parents and friends.what I can't support is the constant pain and the leech to society I've become. There's no hope for me. Like seriously I've tried it all.

I binge drink about once a week and every time I do, I take it too far and cause damage to myself and everyone around me. my family and friends are so disappointed in me, and I am too. I don’t know who I am when I look in the mirror. I go through life in a fog, nothing feels real and everything seems so pointless and it’s been this way since I was about 12. I attempted suicide twice when I was 13. I went to the psych ward and they didn’t help me at all. They didn’t care. I didn’t see one single therapist while I was there, just a doctor who kept asking me the same painful questions and was very rude. I can’t keep a job because my anxiety hinders me from going out into the real world and being normal. I’m toxic. I neglect myself and the people I love.

1376,"I gave up Reddit for Lent, and this is what I learned For the last couple years or so, I've been active on Reddit almost every day. Gradually, Reddit became the only thing I did for fun on my phone. I've never been that into games, and I've abandoned most other social apps. And I don't regret that. Reddit is awesome. But it became a source of daily comfort for me, and therefore when it came time to give something up for Lent, it just made sense. My wife and I aren't particularly religious, but we decided to do Lent this year as an exercise in self control. So I deleted the Reddit app off my phone and removed it from my Chrome bookmarks, and beyond a thread popping up in the odd Google search, I haven't read a word of Reddit content for the last 47 days. And here is what the experience has taught me:  1. Facebook is a BUMMER. If you want to be pissed off at the world, irritated at people you like, and annoyed by irrelevant ads, go to Facebook. But without Reddit to kill those small increments of time we spend waiting for things, I turned to this old standby. Facebook has sucked for a long time, but I keep it for other people's sake. Most of the older generation of my family can barely stomach the idea of Facebook, and to them switching to something else is about like switching from cars to rocket ships as their primary means of transportation. They had a hard enough time switching to Facebook from their hand-written address books. I love these people, and I want to stay in touch with them, and I cannot in good conscience ask them to abandon the fragile comfort they've found in the digital age. So when it comes to sharing pics and videos of my daughter, a private Facebook group allows everyone to participate. But for me, as a way of killing 5-10 minutes, Facebook is about equal to self-flagellation.  2. I miss reading books. Without social media to kill time, I turned to ebooks. I discovered that Google's Play Books app is actually really powerful, and the Play Store has a huge library of classic books for bargain prices. I stocked up on a bunch of bucket list items, and even dove into a few heady volumes that have been on my shelves for a while. For the first time in years, I'm actively reading 5 books. I've always been one of those multiple-books-at-once people, but in the past couple years Reddit usurped that reading time. I like to have different books for different reading spots: one for each bathroom in my house, and one for bedtime. And I like to have different ebooks for different spans of time. If I have 5 minutes to kill, I'll page through a comic book. If I have an hour or more, I'll read Plato or Proust. Over the last 47 days I've rediscovered my interest in reading, and I was surprised to find I didn't miss the stuff I read on Reddit at all. Which leads me to the next thing I learned.  3. What I miss about Reddit is having a place to post things. I'm not particularly witty, and I don't really have a strong need for attention, but every now and then I will happen to come up with a meme, or shower thought, or discussion topic that my Facebook friends might not get, but that the wider internet would probably like. And Facebook is a terrible place to post that kind of stuff. It won't appear in most of your friends' feeds, and the ones who see it will either ignore it, or they won't understand it, and will post some awkward comment forcing you to explain your joke/reference, and the whole thing becomes exhausting. This post is a perfect example. Most of my Facebook friends don't even know what Reddit is, so they wouldn't understand. And virtually none of them would bother reading a post of this length.  4. The other thing I miss about Reddit is those rare, valuable moments where you really make a connection with someone. This is one of those areas where the anonymity of Reddit really works in your favor. Here, people are much more bold with the things they're willing to discuss because the social consequences of vulnerability are virtually non-existent. I follow a few support-group-ish subs, and on more than one occasion I've been able to jump straight into a deep conversation without all the awkwardness and small talk that gets in the way in real life. Even online, when you're talking to people you know, every relationship has baggage that prevents you from getting real with people. Here you can skip that. Don't get me wrong, Reddit is still 99% mental junk food. Hell, the whole internet is. But at least here there aren't any built in barriers to deep conversation.  So now that it's Easter, I'm back. And I'll probably still use Reddit every day. But it's not going to be like it was. The mindless content browsing? I didn't miss that at all. If I have 5 mins to kill, maybe. But any more time than that, and I'd rather be reading. And when I'm here, I'm going to try to focus on more meaningful interactions. I'll probably never have a life completely free of mental junk food, but I've learned that I never really liked it as much as I thought I did.",cc,1,0.12,0.09

I have this horrible habit of watching youtube/browsing reddit instead of doing my homework so I figured, ""Hey might as well give this a try."" Well one of the steps to ridding yourself of your bad habit was to find the underlying cause/reason that you participate in this habit. So I did some thinking. Why do I watch youtube/browse reddit so much. And the answer is quite simple. I use it to fill the missing social interaction in my life. I don't have any close friends, so to make up for it I watch videos/read reddit to feel that connectedness. When I do these things I feel like I am a part of a group, like there are other people out there who understand me and would be friends with me.

1383,"How do y’all organize your music playlists? So I’m relatively young but I’m absolutely neck deep in music. I use Spotify and the native Apple app (for mixtapes and CD’s that you can’t stream) and I was super overwhelmed by the sheer amount of music I had amassed. My Spotify looks like this - https://imgur.com/a/ljCfy  Each playlist has between 50-300 songs on it. I had to create more to separate out my music because I’d have playlists with different genres and sounds in it, and it was just a weird listening experience.  So, to my question!   How do you all organize what you listen to? Do you break it down by release years? Genres? Etc?  And an example: I’ve really been getting into ‘60s-‘80s music of all genres and have been making up a bunch of playlists for that. I have one for the 60’s, 70’s, 80’s and so on. Now my dilemma is that I want each one to sound cohesive, but I wasn’t around back then. So to me, a some of the late 60’s stuff sounds like it should be grouped with 70’s stuff.   Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and Creedence all had very popular (nowadays anyway) albums come out in ‘68 or ‘69. But they sound like 70’s songs to me. Do I include them in with the 70’s songs? Because then they wouldn’t be true decades playlists, but having Zeppelin and Jimi and Creedence with like The Doors, Buffalo Springfield, The Yardbirds, etc sounds kinda weird?

I've been having some trouble with my parents; more specifically, them giving me more freedom with various aspects of my life.  Usually, they're pretty cool with this kind of thing, like if I wanted to go out with friends, but with technology, they have this stigma.  In particular, I want more freedom with my phone, or at least the ability to keep it in my room at night.  They have their own reasons for not letting me, but this policy was put into place a few years ago (when, truthfully, I wasn't getting enough sleep).  Now, I know the value of sleep, but I just wish they weren't so on top of me about when I do go to sleep or wake up.  Additionally, their attitude that it's improper to text in bed is a bit archaic to me.  I certainly understand their point of view but I just think it's a new age now and... why does it matter if I text at my desk or in bed?  My bed is way comfier than my chair.  I know this will sound really entitled/spoiled, but I just wish they cared less about me and what I do.

1425,"Went on a hike today (#87) My dad's old college buddy likes to go on hikes and he sends out mass invites to people about every other month to join him. I always was interested in going on a hike so back in November my dad asked me to tag along at it was fun. He did the same for today and it was again fun and quite an adventure.  Two other people who showed up last time (excluding me, my dad, and his friend) were there today as were three different people. My dad's friend and the one lady who showed up both times bring their dogs along (he owns a fat dachshund named Ella and she owns a golden retriever named Koby). Except for crossing a couple of water creeks, Ella is able to do the entire hike by herself despite her size and stumpy legs. Koby runs back and forth over and over and over and he often lays in puddles/water or rolls around in dirt. They make the hikes so much more fun.  We actually got lost today somehow. Apparently this crew often crosses from path to path instead of staying on the same one all the time (cause they always go to the same park so it'd get boring doing it that way) and when we switched to one path, even though we all thought there was only one possible direction to go, we went the wrong way. We managed to find our way back and eventually got to the cars. The hike started at 10am and (including a few short breaks and a far too long lunch break) we finished at 6pm. We apparently did around 6.5 miles according to one of the guy's hiking app. A lot of it was uphill but that's not much of a problem.  I haven't run much at all the past few months so my cardio is kinda shit right now (screw treadmills even though I'm in the gym 3-4 times a week) so it was a bit tiring at some points, but I could have kept going for much longer I felt. Or at least without the breaks. But since everyone else in the hiking group is somewhere between their mid-30s to late-50s, not everyone was as energetic as I was. My dad's friend has two bad knees and so when the painkillers wore off he really needed to rest more and more.   When I actually have free time when the semester ends to get a life, I would like sign up for hikes using the MeetUp app so I could hopefully hike with people more around my age (since I can't really find any of my own friends who'd be interested) because hiking definitely is a fun thing to do. I love the outdoors.  Do you ever do activities with your parents for fun? (or did you back when you lived at home if you don't anymore)  What are your thoughts on hiking?

A couple weeks ago me and my parents got into a pretty big fight, and I came out of it feeling pretty useless and like I was a burden on everyone in my life.  Throughout the course of my life, me and my parents have always disagreed on stuff and had fights. It’s just part of life. However, when it’s all “said and done” my parents say that they still “love me”.  Part of me wants to believe it, but another-darker- part of me doesn’t even consider the possibly that anyone could “love me”.  I’ve gotten used to being yelled at and containing my feelings during these fights. But afterwords, I break down and cry in my bed with thoughts of suicide filling my mind as I sob into my pillow.  The most prominent of these thoughts being that I’m worthless, and that I have no purpose in life other than being a burden on everyone.   The only reason I haven’t actually “done it” yet is that I’m terrified of what’s going to happen afterwords.  I already know what people are going to say, since they’ve all said it before. “You have so much to live for”, “you have your whole life ahead of you”, “you’ll get past it”.

1480,"16 and depressed and wanting to kill myself on my birthday Log in / Register r/SuicideWatch 16 and hopeless u/SilentTears0 Im 16 in 11th grade and i feel like i have nowhere to go in life. I take 2 AP courses both of which I suck so bad at. Even my regular classes are tough to me.so I had to drop out to just escape the sad cruel reality.. I feel like im just a dumb retard sometimes that i cant even understand basic math or even what the teacher is telling me. no matter how hard i study i always get simple mistakes and even looking at the people who fool around in class they always get higher grades. even my friends who always complain that theyre gonna ""fail"" and that they did so ""bad"" in the end get 90 or high 80s and then theres me with the 70s and 60s. Even at home my parents hate each other its just constant argueing and im not allowed any privacy. I barely have any friends because its hard for me to socialize and talk to people. Im scared for my SAT cause i suck so much at math and now i feel like i dont even deserve to go to college. all my cousins and aunts and uncles do so well in their education and they achieve so much and even my brother is the complete opposite of me. Hes so intelligent, naturally intelligent, and he has a lot of friends. Its like i was born the black sheep. I have a dream job but that job is hard to get because its in the medical field and highly competitive so now im even questioning whats the point of living my life anymore what is even my purpose. im not smart, cant socialize, i really dont have anything i can say that im proud of. I feel like im ruining my life. Its not only my academic life its just me in general. I feel like i was born with a mental illness that makes me incapable of talking to people. Even striking up a conversation and keeping it going is such a hard challenge for me that comes so naturally to most normal people. Thats why i barely have any friends and people think theres something wrong with me cause they always see me alone. And my its my family too. I grew up with a dad that has anger issues and fits of rage. I have really bad memories of that and sometimes it comes back in episodes and i have to lock myself in a bathroom to cry. And my sister before she left for college all she did was put me down. Everysingle word that came out of my mouth he would criticize it and nobody would do anything about it. It was like that for 3 years straight. Its funny how people always say ""im always there for you"" when they never are.Now i dont know whats the point anymore of my life. Sometimes i think of suicide i never consider it but i just think of it. Sometimes i space out in class and feel like to go somewhere alone to cry. Most of the time i feel this emptiness and loneliness. I can never even stand up for myself. Even if i get bullied or someone says something about me thats not true i can never stand up. I hate myself for that. That im just this quiet passive girl who cant get directly mad at people. In my head i always say so much stuff to the people that did me wrong but when it comes to real i just say ""its okay"". Why cant i ever say what im feeling? I know why. Its cause im scared of losing the few friends i have. I always happen to piss people off and when they get mad at me even if its unfair i always try to blame it on myself and understand them because im too scared that if i say anything theyll get even more mad and stop being my friend. I guess this is the life i have to live as a socially awkward introvert who anyone can step on all they want. And i do have one talent that i was born with and its drawing. I always drew. I love singing I sing my feelings but now its always sad songs Am i depressed?

So I feel like I have found a way to ""cure"" my depression, but my cure is to transition and it is making her more depressed.  I haven't started any medical transition yet, but I have been transitioning socially for about 8 months. And my depression is lower and less frequent now than it has been in years, I feel like I really am doing the right thing for my own mental health.  My wife tries to be supportive. She uses my preferred pronouns and outwardly supports me, but it's killing her inside. She won't talk to me about it because she says I'm too sensitive and defensive about it. She has also said that I'm becoming narcissistic, and I can see what she means. I recognize the behaviors in myself and I'm trying not to be, but I think it stems from my trying to fight the shame of being trans that I've felt most of my life. My wife is openly bisexual (she came out right after I came out as trans) but she has never had a relationship with a woman. She has also been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which makes her very hard on herself and gives her severe social anxiety. So she has nobody to talk to because she has no friends and isn't very close to her family. She's a very intelligent person, she just got her Masters degree and is going to get a PhD.  She also told me this morning that people with BPD have around an 80% suicide attempt rate. And that it is basically on her mind all the time.  I really really don't know what to do. I've found a treatment for my depression, but it's making her's worse. We've been married about 5 years and have talked about getting a divorce multiple times.

I started thinking about where I see myself going in life, and the answer was.. nowhere. I haven't even finished highschool yet because I lack the motivation, i lose focus and I feel like a fucking failure for it. I don't want to work a dead end job, live in my shitty hometown and just scrape by. I'm so tired of this. I've been actively suicidal since I was 13, in and out of the hospital until I was 17 for numerous attempts and self harm, and because of it i missed out on a fuck ton of school and social interaction. I have social anxiety, so I'm sure the isolation was detremental to my development. I can't even make eye contact with the people close to me, I'm fucking awkward and can't hold conversation, and I feel like puking when people so much as glance at me for more than a second. I absolutely despise myself. Today i broke. I cut myself. And I feel numb. I don't want to tell my boyfriend (I'm not sure if it's because I'm scared he'll be angry at me, break up with me or pity me. I hate when people give me that look, like I'm some small hurt animal that they want to fix) but I'm not sure i can hide it from him.

The longer I watched her switch back and forth between the sides (there's a platform with my desk just above the floor), the more I thought it was a cockroach (something I loathed as much).   Well, something went near the boxes I've yet to put away (oh, how I'm going to HATE cleaning it now). My cat, Monsoon, was sniffing quite a bit in the corner. That was when I went to get a hardcover book, preparing for the worst. Oh, I thought it was a cockroach all right. I shined my phone light where it was likely to come out. My room's pretty small so I had to be quick before it reaches under my bed.  But no....  What came around? Well, first I heard it. It was crawling out all right. Slow and steady. I was ready. Then I heard the orange bag that was on my floor begin to make creasing sounds. Like something...heavy. I saw it, right then. He was a big one all right. But oh no, not a cockroach...a freaking wolf spider. I could only mouth what the heck before Monsoon made a dash for it.   It KNEW what was going to happen.

Then my Aunt came in to help, tried to take it out with a shoe at one point, to which it jumped about a foot in the air, making us scurry out of our room.

1534,"Designer clothes (#85) I was talking to one of my friends earlier about clothes for a little bit. Her family has more money than most of our friend group but she is super humble about it and not many people are even aware since she doesn't flaunt it. However, when she goes shopping she does tend to go for the big designer brands because she can afford it. She always offers to pay for everything for everyone though because she understands that she is more fortunate financially than most of her friends and she doesn't like seeing people suffer money wise or in any other way. I always try to refuse when she does this just cause I'm not a fan of people spending money on me. I also joke and tell her that I always go straight for the clearance racks when I am out shopping (which ins't really that much of a joke since I do honestly do that, but it's just fun to joke about with her). She was saying tonight that we should go shopping together for our athletic banquet in May and she said we won't go to the super expensive stores even though she wants to get me designer type clothes/items. I told her that for the past three years I've gone to TJMaxx and gotten my dress for the banquet there.  I personally have never been a fan of designer clothing. All of the big names in women's fashion (that I'm even aware of because I know barely any names) just don't look cute to me whereas the more affordable stuff generally looks better and fits nicer on me.   This could also stem from the fact that I just automatically put down anything that has a big price tag as unappealing to me. Growing up my parents struggled to pay bills and I watched as my dad worked his ass off to get every promotion possible to be able to get a bigger paycheck; he even needed to get a second job for a while. My brother really liked the Nike Air Jordan sneakers and would buy them constantly, to the point where my parents would yell at him about money. Me, leading a life where my entire goal was to avoid being yelled at, saw this and determined that spending money was a bad thing so I always saved. Not to mention the recession started when I was about 10/11ish and I still think we're in it even though I know we're not. These are just some of all the factors that have made me someone who watches my money a bit too closely. Designer brands are beyond luxury and I have no interest in ever getting them for myself.   Also some girl made fun of me in high school for not knowing who Tory Burch was and when I googled it later in the day I saw that those clothes were really ugly and expensive personally.

1553,"I hope someone reads this, even if its one person. I want to get some stuff off my chest, it's too much to tell my family so they won't know why I am killing myself I feel like a literal dysfunction of the brain. I've been mentally and physically abused from a very young age until I was 7, although, it still felt like quite a normal life. When my dad left and I was just being raised by my mom it was the best time of my life. As sad as it is, from 7 until 13 was the only time I ever had friends. Actual genuine friends who I had fun with and considered family. During this time though was when one of the contributors to my fucked up brain was coming to fruition. My brother introduced me to porn, when I was very young. He taught me how to masturbate and that evolved into me and him masturbating under his sheets together. Then one day he proposed the idea that we jack each other off while we were taking a bath. (forgot to mention he is 3 years older than me) This caused me to have a fucked up psychological state for a long time. I thought I was gay for a long time even though I knew a hundred percent I was attracted to women. I have fucked up sexual desires due to this. I'm attracted to my fucking cousin. I'm not gonna go into more depth about this because it's too painful being self aware of the fucked up thoughts I have. Anyways, we moved to Jakarta when I was in grade 7, that's when my social life ended. All my traumas came back and I just couldn't socialize. It was terrifying and I ended up becoming addicted to my computer. I had no friends for 2 years and only superficial relationships with other losers. In my freshman year I took some action and went out to parties. Went out a few times drinking until I met some other people that were pretty cool, I still kept up a fake persona so I could not connect with anyone. Drank at least once a week. Then I moved to Kyiv in grade 10, my first school I went to was terrible. All my fault, because I ruined it for myself, I closed myself in with defensive walls, and was an unintentional asshole causing everyone to hate me. I dropped out to do online courses suddenly by just not showing up to school one day. My mom allowed me to do that because she noticed the dire situation I was in. The online courses turned into me spending a whole year in one room without leaving almost ever. I played games and watched movies and youtube videos. I coped with my shitty life by drowning in dopamine giving tools on my laptop. My mom went crazy throughout the year because I was failing the online courses and was just fucking around. In this year I met one guy, I'll call him Owen. Me and Owen weren't really friends. Just two losers who got together because we were rejected by all others. Me and him smoked a lot of weed together. I don't know why I smoked weed because every time I did I became extremely anxious and closed off. He witnessed my mental decline first hand. He definitely noticed I was not okay. We also discovered hard drugs that year. We met some guy that became our drug dealer one night when we were searching for a strip club. One thing led to another and we met some ukrainian pimp who also deals drugs. The first time I asked him if he had ecstasy he said yea, and when we actually got it, it was some paper with a MOUND of white powder. We didn't know it was speed at the time, we had absolutely no idea what we were taking. We didn't snort it, we ate the speed. The night started out, we felt the effects about 20 minutes in. It was crazy. Too fucking crazy. I started talking non stop. I think I was repeating the word fuckin all throughout the night. The most terrifying thing was that we both blacked out for a majority of the night, and my mom was about 10 meters away in her room. He stopped talking, all night he became a mute. I was terrified. I thought he had lost his mind. So I panicked and was trying to get him to say something, literally anything. It was a clusterfuck. We could have easily OD'd that night, the fucking drug dealer was trying to get us hooked so we would be recurring customers. I black out, and then I hear my moms voice at 8am in the morning. As soon as I hear her voice I snap out of the trance. Still fucked, I had to go to the store with her and her friends. We went and as we were going I was trying to keep my cool although still tripping hard. Anyways I did it just fine, my friend stayed at my place and said he saw ghosts. I did this stuff a few more times, it got to the point where I starting picking through the carpet, looking for anything that ever resembles speed to get another hit. I stopped myself before it got too bad. Then we discovered ecstasy. Oooooh man is ecstasy wonderful. It is honestly one of the highlights of my life. Still gonna do it again sometime soon. When we started out we did it too often. Like once or twice a week. I'd be trying to trick my mom into giving me my allowance by changing the progress bar on the website of my online school. It worked a few times. After bingeing a lot we decided to take it easy. We did some research on how to roll safely, and tried. I still pop molly to this day but a lot less frequently. The molly was also pretty bad, it contributed to my intense depression. After a year of absolute hell, I was ready. After only socializing with Owen and my mom for a year I wanted to be better. This time I was gonna be outgoing and have lots of friends. I started school again at the other international school. My first day was cringe but far better because I was optimistic. To give you an idea I introduced myself to a group of guys in my grade, nearly my whole grade, and when they asked where I was from I said, ""I'm white""(I met some other guys that were pretty cool though"". Now we're at the part of the story where I am living now. I've made a decent amount of friends. Still don't consider them close friends. More like school friends. I've blocked myself off with my ""Defensive walls"" again, and this time people don't hate me they are just weirded out by me. Still though, I'm proud of what I've achieved. I get invited to parties, and what not. I still feel empty though. I feel like I want to improve myself but I don't have the energy to do so. Even if I wanted to, I would be working at a lost cause, because I feel that due to my experience my brain is deteriorating and I am incapable of being who I want to be. I'll never become someone I'll be proud of. I'll never be proud of myself. And above all. I am literally unable to have a human connection. I've lost touch with family. Even the mom I live with, I do not connect with her. I've lost 99.9% of my social skills. I am beyond salvageable. I feel like all of that can be fixed by just erasing myself from this world. Death is natural. I do not belong and that's fine with me. My existence will only cause more problems in the future, for my family and for those around me. My children will have my dna, which will leave them handicapped. We are all part of the game of life, natural selection is selecting against me. I guess I am just not meant to be. I am going to kill myself, but I am letting this come to the grave with me. I just needed to tell someone, just needed to get it off my chest so at least one person could see this. I feel like an asshole for killing myself, because I know it will cause immense pain for my mom and my brother (which I do not hold any grudges against despite what he did, he was young stupid and also traumatised), I hope they will understand, and if not I will explain when we meet again where this fucked up life of mine is out of the picture.",sw,0,0.094,0.099

Not important but oh man I want to move.  Today I was on the 6 train heading downtown. As we were pulling into 14th street/Union Square the train conductor started making announcements as required explaining what stop we're at and what transfers are available. I was only half paying attention because I had headphones on but I did hear her say "".. 42nd street with connections to the 7 and shuttle to Times Square ... "" and I thought that was odd because I had gotten on the train at 42nd street so I should've been much further away. Then there was a pause where she must have realized her mistake and then started saying the correct stop and all the trains you could transfer to. But what made this great was she was laughing the entire time. Her laugh was so genuine and hearty too which made me smile but when I quickly glanced around the subway car, nobody else seemed to be paying any mind to what was being said. For the rest of the time I was on the train she got herself under control and correctly announced all the other stops.  I just found that moment to be a particularly nice thing that happened today. I have no idea what was going through her head that made her confuse the stations but she owned it and was able to laugh it off.

I can't go back to being alone after knowing them. did you know they took care or me when I was drunk? these people sat with me all night, said they loved me, gave me a place to stay and breakfast in the morning. my family wouldn't do that. but they're human, in the end. when I break down, really break down, there won't be a person who can say they didn't know. they'll leave me for someone lower maintenence. and I'm close.

1593,"Do you think it's condescending to tell a child 'Your parents raised you well'? I remember my mother telling me off when I was eleven for going to school with muddy trousers. I'd played a bit of rugby after school and wore the same trousers the next day without washing them because I didn't consider it much of a problem at the time. My mum was upset that I hadn't washed them or wore clean ones, and when it was clear that I didn't understand the problem at all, she threw in that it also makes teachers think that she's not looking after me. I didn't understand this at the time, because in my mind it was my responsibility to wash my clothes not hers, but as I got older this memory stuck with me and I realised it's the truth. The way a child acts and appears reflects massively on the parents, but as a child I didn't view it that way.  So my question comes from last night. I was playing the game *Fortnite Battle Royale*, and for those not familiar with the game you can get paired up with three other strangers and have to work together to beat all the other teams. Teamwork is essential, and using your microphones to chat is also really useful.  I was paired up with a twelve-year-old boy and two American college students. I don't usually like playing with children, but this kid was pretty polite and a nice guy to play with. He wasn't good at the game, but he did his best to share all the items he got with the team and gave us all the info he had so no problems there.  Something that bugged me though is that the two other guys repeatedly told him 'your parents raised you well' whenever he said please/thank you or helped us out. He always replied with an awkward laugh and a 'thanks', but to me, it seems condescending to say that kind of thing. I didn't speak up at the time because that would make things awkward.

I burst into tears at sports practice, there’s a voice in my head constantly harassing me, I fantasize about my death and how it would affect others every day. I want people to miss me. I want everybody to realize how much (or little) I mean(t) to them.   I know this isn’t healthy or normal. I’m seeing a therapist now, which is neat. My parents brought me to therapy at my request but I didn’t tell them what for. I don’t want to give them the burden.  I don’t want to explain why I feel so bad to them.   My parents lead very busy, stressful lives as it is. They work in law, which is a tiring field to be in. The family dog is sick and lethargic right now.  They’re redoing the house and have to make a lot of decisions. There’s so much stuff on their plates right now, I don’t want to distract them from it and add more to worry about. I don’t want to break my mom’s heart.   I’ve told them before I felt like I want to end my life but quickly took it back saying I would never do it and I was being hyperbolic.

I had a thought in the shower about distant future when humans will colonise Mars and possibly other planets (in an optimistic scenario, where we are able to solve/postpone the problems of global climate change, nuclear war, etc). Assuming that global political and economical system is more or less the same (maybe, more civility), what would be the legal and political grounds for Martian society?  Private companies like SpaceX probably will be on the forefront of exploration, with state agencies tailing them closely. So, the first stations/settlements probably will be organized by a bunch of different state and private agents like ISS and operate in the same framework? But the astro/kosmonauts on ISS only stay for a short time, and even then US and Russian space agencies basically decide everything for them. Permanent settlers would probably want to have a voice in development of the colony. But imagine if SpaceX funded 50% of the mission and sent 2 permanent settlers, whereas NASA shelled out for another 50% and sent 10. Would they all have the same vote, or SpaceXers will be more ""valuable"" so to speak?  Moreover, what if someone commits a crime while in such a colony? With no police and united legal framework (maritime law???) how the punishment or retribution will be decided upon? Furthermore, people would probably engage in some sort of economic exchange. How and through what could it be regulated? And should it be regulated?  History provides is with some perspective on distant colonies where people dumped something/someone they did not want that much (sorry, Oz), as well as resource-valuable colonies governments and private companies competed for, but Martian situation is quite different from both. Or not?   What kind of culture / sentiment towards ""mainland"" and its separated governments life in such colony would create?

The part where the guy is on his knees and the girl walks around him - the way she looks at him was so cute. I know it's just part of the choreo, but it was like ""I wish I could find someone who looked at me like that"".

So I guess I’ll say this, my name is Morgan I’m a 13 year old girl and I started self harming.  I don’t want people to say “you’re to young to know what depression is!” Or something like that because I’ve been going through it for YEARS  I am FULLY aware that self harm isn’t “good” but that doesn’t mean just because you say stop it means I’m going to magically stop  Ya I’m 13 but that doesn’t mean I should get judged for my problem! I’m saying all this because many many people seem to not understand how mental health works  But off to the topic I suppose. I started to self harm last month or maybe 2 by now? I can’t remember but not that long ago. It started out with just scratching my arm without stopping into cutting. I started to scratch myself with a way to help with my emotions (at the time I wasn’t actually as depressed as now I was with the said person who caused said problem and they made me happy, foolish thinking back on it.) then after said person decided he wanted me to hate him he did a lot that mentally just destroyed me. I wasn’t myself at all. I started to want to kill my self and I started to cut myself with scissors.

1903,"A social trend I've noticed, really like and wanted to share. Hello CC!  I'll try to make this a quick and easy read without too much filler.  It all started when I was eight... jk  I first noticed it last year around august when I worked a private security gig for a friends wedding. All of the people there were the high end, upper-crust types. I remember the bride and groom and most of their friends were performers in that circus show in Las Vegas whose name I always forget, their parents were land developers all over the US, and the guests were all very well off.  Me being of a more modest lifestyle (broke-ass mofo) I felt pretty out of place with the crowd and for a while I feet I was the only non-white person there. I was convinced that I was sticking out like a sore thumb. Nobody there knew me, it was actually my first time meeting any of the people there other than my friend. I felt like I made everyone uncomfortable by being present all the time. I stood at the table of honor with my friend and even wound up in some of the family pictures.  Right, I was going for brevity.  Anyway the entire wedding goes off with only a few hitches and as we are saying our good-byes to the happy couple they thank me for helping out and then they invite me to their family-only party, IN PERFECT SPANISH!  I know I probably shouldn't be as shocked by that as I was but I still found it crazy cool that they spoke spanish. I don't mean the blocky and awkward spanish from high school that you forgot immediately after graduating. These kids were speaking it as if they had just moved in from Guadalajara. They had a small accent but other than that they spoke like a native.  I complimented them on their spanish and they said that they had picked it up from their nannies who would speak to them almost exclusively in spanish growing up.  I went to the party and wound up having a great time, we would throw little jabs back and forth and I found that they didn't just speak the language, they had the mannerisms and nuances of mexican culture down too.Most of the staff was mexican and they all got along really well. Typically when I meet staff of wealthy home owners staff rarely like the people they work for but this was not the case here.  Since I've gotten to know more of my friends friends I have noticed the same thing with their kids who either speak spanish or some other language that they pick up from their nannies\house keepers\gardeners. I also notice that people who have formed these connections with their ethnic employees tend to be much more respectful towards ethnic people or people of different tax brackets.  So what is the point of this super brief and concise post?  I feel that even with all the crap that we see in the news and online, despite the general feel of having to fear everyone out there who is remotely different and regardless of those who go out of their way to spread hatred and bigotry; society as a whole is moving towards a more progressive, accepting and open future and I really hope I live long enough to see it.

What's wrong with kids watching barney on their parents' phones during a long road trip? Not to mention that should they wish, they can use that phone to learn new things on the fly. An exciting new frontier for education.  On the other hand, children at that age are rapidly developing their cognitive function so by ""spoiling"" them of content, parents are irresponsibly depriving them of unique experiences that brings with it a unique lesson that's invaluable to their character. This is different from Television in that now you can potentially be on a device every waking moment of your childhood.  I'm in the latter camp personally, I've never liked seeing kids with screens in their hands all the time. Although obviously there's merit in the words ""everything in moderation.""",cc,1,0.119,0.037

1966,"I drove a random stranger back to their home. Settle down folks, this is gonna be a long one!  It was a Thursday morning about three or four weeks ago and I was sat in my Pharmacology class slowly feeling the impeding doom of an anxiety attack. I was toying with the idea of ditching the class I had after lunch and going home to play some video games in hopes of making my day better. Lunch time rolls around and I decide to go home, I pick up my favourite salad and drive home.   I'm about to dig in when I think to myself M1chael_Burnham, this could tastes 100 times better if you inhaled some dead plant smoke. So I quickly roll up and head outside to smoke. As I'm walking around the corner (my apartment block is on the corner of a busy main road and a dead end, I prefer to smoke on the dead end road) I see a girl across the road looking lost and I start repeating ""please don't ask for directions"" quietly to myself. I stupidly make eye contact with her and she shouts across the road asking where she was. Being the nice person I am I decide to explain to her, ""you're on Discovery"". I chuckled myself as I found myself in a situation I didn't want to be in, but that was fine. She crosses the street and she explains that she isn't a local, she looked desperate, lost and scared. I ask her where she's from and she tells me she's from a town that's 30mins away and then she just started bawling her eyes out explaining that she had been spiked the night before and had spent the most part of the day locked in a strange man's room. She'd just had to push the guy out of the way with the door as he came back into the room and just ran until she found me. She asked if she could use my phone to call a friend, he didn't pick up. I asked her if she wanted to get the police involved because I know some people are a bit iffy about policemen/women. She immediately says no, I then suggest giving her directions to the nearest bus station and she says she has no money, she only had a very old Nokia phone on her and she was wearing a hoodie, leggings and some Nikes. As I looked closely at her I noticed visible bruises on her wrists & back of neck, I really wanted to call the police but I also didn't want to make her feel like she cannot trust me. We tried calling her friend again and there was no answer. As I'm looking around me I see my car parked on the road and I just blurt out that I'll take her home since it's only a 30min drive. I immediately regret it as I realise I'm inviting a complete stranger into my car, I further explain that I'll only take her if a friend of mine comes with us, just to be safe and she was fine with that. If anything she was grateful.   We jump in the car, pick up my friend (who happened to be about a mile away luckily). I offered the girl some breakfast bars I keep in my car for homeless people and she just devoured them, like she hadn't eaten in days. Again I think about calling the police so I  ask her her age just to make sure I'm not driving a minor and she says sh2es 22, I didn't believe her but she had an expired provisional license on her which confirmed her age. I made sure to drive as safe as possible because I didn't want to have a car crash or something with a total stranger in the car, how would I explain that one!?  We get to her house and her friend we'd tried calling earlier was standing outside visibly freaked out (I think they'd been out together the night before) he was very grateful for bringing her back. I gave the girl my number just to keep in contact and she said she'd call or text to let me know how she's doing. She didnt.   I feel stupid, like I got played/lied to. On the other hand I couldn't just leave her to fend for herself because if I had been in her situation I'd want help too.  I don't know if I'm over thinking it but I feel like I shouldn't have taken her home, that I should have called the police and had them help her. No one but my boyfriend and the friend who came with me know, and I guess you guys now. Was I wrong? Should I have left her? Should I have called the police?

2036,"Meeting up with old friends (#93) ^^^^I'd ^^^^like ^^^^to ^^^^state ^^^^that ^^^^I ^^^^started ^^^^writing ^^^^this ^^^^before ^^^^midnight ^^^^so ^^^^ha  Today me and five friends from high school met up for the first time together in over a year. When I was in high school I became really close with a group of girls who were a year ahead of me and they're really the only people from my high school I keep in touch with (despite going to such a small school where everyone knew each other). We're always so busy though so it's hard to get everyone together. We were meeting for dinner at an hip Italian food place which I originally wasn't excited for because I've had Italian food too often than I'm not interested in it.  Anyway, so I worked out at school before I met up with any of them and I was going to meet up with one person around noonish. When I called her it turned out we were on complete opposite sides of Manhattan. So instead of being smart and picking a spot to meet up at we decided to walk along an avenue until we found each other. This entailed a lot of back and forth and phone calls asking ""where are you"" until I finally told her don't move and I'll come to you. We then went to get food and had awesome bacon burgers and then we walked through Central Park.  In the park we went up and down so many paths and eventually got near the area where I always practiced for cross country so I showed her around there. We started at the south east corner and when we were finally leaving the park we were at the north west corner (and it was fun with how we left because I didn't feel like looking for a path that actually would leave out the park and so we climbed down a hill to one of the exits instead).  Then we took the subway down to around China Town and walked uptown to get ice cream at a place that makes ice cream rolls. Then we walked to The Strand book store (probably the biggest independent bookstore in Manhattan) and we walked around there for a while. I bought a couple of books, a pair of corgi socks, and an improv game.  Finally it was around the time we were supposed to meet everyone so we waited at a park and collected our group then went over to the Italian food place. It was hard to find seating for all six of us but we managed to get a table and then when we got our food (it was a counter-service style place, not a normal Italian restaurant) the chef was super chill and making jokes with us as she prepared our food. The food was so much better than I was expecting. We all talked and talked for a while since it's been so long since most of us had seen each other. We started playing the improv game (it's called Human Beings if you're curious) and we had a bunch of fun with that. Then we got desert at a gelato place (I got hot chocolate since I love that and I already had ice cream earlier in the day). While we were just chilling on a bench outside the gelato place I did one of my trademark activities with my friends which is: read passages of a book that are totally normal in a really seductive voice. That is always fun and turns into a wild ride. We then realized it was 10pm and passed some of our bedtimes (we're old ladies despite all being 21-23) and so we headed for the subway. Only one of my friends lives near me so she took the train all the way with me and then my dad dropped her off at home instead of having her wait for the bus she had just missed.  It was so fun catching up with all of my friends. Even though we have diverse interests (and I personally cannot mention my political opinions around them since they differ so much) we all love and support each other and are all amazed by what everyone is doing. We were all the nerds in high school and still have maintained ourselves well as the years have gone on. We can have such long and deep conversations about basically anything and it's awesome. We're all entering actual adulthood now with everyone graduating/going into grad school/getting full time jobs and it's so crazy how when we all became friends our biggest worries were tests and papers. They're a really good friend group and I hope to never lose them.  What was the most you ever walked in a day?  Do you have any weird talents? (like me and the reading of the books)  Ever go to a place to eat with really low expectations and end up surprised with how good the food was? or vice versa?

2043,Here we go again Ok so I’ve been depressed for so long. My depression came back after only like 4 months at uni and it all went downhill. My gender issues cropped up again - questioning if I was transgender. It’s hard enough dealing with depression while at uni - let alone thinking you might be trans and having to transition. Anyway I jumped off a bridge 11 March and have been in hospital ever since. I’m still so depressed and now I’m extra depressed about my injuries. I’m still able to walk and hopefully my bladder and bowels will get back to normal. It’s horrible - I feel so trapped. I feel like there’s nothing to leave hospital for and I dread being in the outside world so much. I actually can’t stand being seen and it’s been a constant problem for me. Now every time I wake up I’m reminded of my attempt and also the uncertainty of whether my bowels and bladder will get back to normal is eating away at me. Im so depressed I feel like damaging my chances of physical recovery. My time in this hospital is nearly over. I have nothing to recover for. Everything is so painful. I was sure I would die and wouldn’t survive and so I neglected everything. Everything is getting to me now - trienfships I’ve neglected - the fact I cant go back to uni this year. I didn’t even want to. The urge to die is overwhelming. Loneliness is killing me. Even though I have people that could maybe visit I can’t face them. I honestly either want to die or just nap all day and not face my issues. I’m so so tempted to end it. I can’t keep on like this. Me surviving has changed nothing about my outlook and I’m just as pessimistic as ever. I still feel like my situation is terrible. And now I have the added stress of physical recovery. I’m so alone. I have no motivation and I can’t keep pretending I can stay in hospital forever but I feel it’s either kill my self in here or as soon as I’m out. All I can think about is ending my life and now things are getting so bad I feel like I need to. I miss my friends but I can’t reach out to them because I wanna die. Every day I wake up and just count down the hours until I can kill myself. I don’t want to ever be in the outside world again or basically start anything again.

She came home from work the other day just to be with me (I work from home) because I was having a breakdown. She supports me through all of my crazy business ideas. She supported me going back to school. She is always there for me and I am terrified I am letting her down. How long can she possibly take this?

2049,"Confused about grad school and life in general Today I got accepted into a very prestigious American university for a graduate healthcare degree. I didn’t think I was going to get in, but I actually got accepted with a scholarship. Even with the scholarship though, it’s very expensive.   My wife and I are very economically conservative despite having high paying jobs in our mid 20s. That being said, we can pay entirely for the degree (it’s part time so I don’t have to quit my job) using my take home salary alone over the next two years while still paying all of our bills and putting money into a savings account. No loans required.   I applied to this program because I wanted my career to have a chance at being meaningful.  I’m young, but working in healthcare technology is a very tangible way that I can see myself putting my skills to good use for the benefit of everyone. I currently work in an industry that I do not find meaningful/worthwhile. It pays the bills, but at the end of the day I’m really only serving myself by earning a paycheck. My work does not make anyone’s lives better (except maybe our shareholders). I’m afraid if I stay in this line of work, I will wake up and 30 comfortable years will have gone by and I’ll have made zero contribution to society.   However, my wife thinks the degree is too expensive. I’ve analyzed our financial situation a hundred different ways, and barring any unforeseen drastic changes in our job status or lifestyle (knock on wood, you never know), we can afford this degree. Our savings account won’t be skyrocketing during it but we can afford it with no loans. We both attended a school for undergrad on a significant scholarship and worked all through college, so we have zero debt at the moment.   I know it’s expensive. But I’ve been thinking about it a lot, that if I WERE to get accepted, what would I do?   I believe that those who are able to help out humanity, in whatever way, should do their part. I believe we have been very blessed - to have no student debt, good jobs, and for me to have gotten accepted into a grad program I never thought I could get into. I believe we are able to do this, and that I can make a difference in someone’s life somewhere by pursuing this degree. I think that makes it worth it.   Am I crazy for thinking this? At the end of my career I want to have made an impact, to have helped others. I want to leave the world a better place when I die than it was when I was born. There are so many pain points in the American healthcare system. This is an industry that needs innovation and I want to be a part of that effort.   Am I being too idealistic here? Maybe too proud? Am I thinking I’m “noble” and “heroic” for wanting to do this, or do you think my heart is in the right place? I would really love to hear anyone’s thoughts. I really need some insight here.

Shipping has to be paid, and with your money. The only exception is subscription services, where you pay a monthly fee. But, the thing is, if the average amazon customer, for example, spends more than $10 a month (cost of prime subscription) in ""free"" shipping... that cost, once again, has to be paid with money from sales.  Idk why I'm writing this I just get a little irritated when people are excited about free shipping. Nothing is free, you're just paying for it in a more roundabout way.

2088,"Every single goddamn thing wrong in my life This is a very long jumble of text. I just feel like my whole life, things have just built on top of each other. I don't even think a single therapist has heard all of the shit I think about. I feel like everything in my life haunts me. And nobody takes it seriously because I need to hit rock bottom first. I don't seem like I need help because I have gotten okay at covering it up. But people around me know I feel this way. It just seems like I am not broken enough for help. But I am. I grew up in a family of four. My parents are immigrants. I have an older brother. He has severe autism and I think my dad expects me to take care of him after they are gone. I can barely take care of myself and I want to move out of the area which I could not with my brother. I don't know how I would hold down a job yet pay someone to take care of him and take care of myself. It means the rest of my life would be dedicated to my brother, not me. I couldn't get married. I am already scared to have kids in case they are autistic. The cultural gap in my family is hard. My mom struggling with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression while insisting on no treatment meant hell for my childhood. 7 year old me spilling a glass of milk meant I got screamed at for the rest of the day. Banshee screaming about how I am a waste of space, stupid, worthless, etc. This goes on for hours in stages. If you say anything, it starts again. My mom has threatened my dad with a knife. She refuses to take any medication. In one of her episodes, she took me and my autistic brother to a homeless shelter because she was convinced my dad was evil. My dad said he went after her as soon as he could but I think part of him wanted to just leave us there. I always prayed for the day my parents would get divorced. They were toxic for each other. My dad has severe anger issues. It just worsened throughout the course of my life. One time, he went to visit his family in India. I was seven and my mom was getting incredibly upset. She broke off a drawer in the kitchen and threatened to hit me with it, nudging it on my shoulder. I called 911 crying. The police officers came. My mom acted somewhat normal but said I was misbehaving. The drawer was on the ground, broken off. They said it was my fault because I misbehaved. They asked if my severely autistic brother was okay. And in that decision I made a choice. Because I heard what happens to people like my brother in the system. And my parents had money. She didn't hurt my brother but I realized that what my brother could potentially go through much worse in the governmental system. They asked if I had anywhere else to stay. I said no. They told me to go upstairs and lock myself there and gave me their number in case she did it again. I called my dad. All he said was ""did it work? Can we try that next time she is upset?"" Never asked if I was okay. I spent that weekend in fear. Just glares, snotty whispers, etc. Whenever I received less than an A, my mom would ignore me. After two days, she would start screaming. That would be a sigh of relief because it meant she would love me again by the end of the week. If she didn't, I was more worried. There were weekly arguments in my house between my parents. They would tell me to go upstairs and ignore them but I would foolishly ask them to stop. They did not care. They only cared about screaming at each other. My dad hates my mom but still cares about her. She had an abusive childhood and the alternative to her staying in our lives would be to be in a mental institution with stigma because she would be a divorced woman according to Indian society even though we live in America. My brother's autism means he can't say I love you. He wouldn't even know if I died. He has so many violent tantrums. He just hits himself repeatedly. He screams like a toddler except he's much much older. There have been so many nights in my life where I didn't sleep. All my grandparents passed away by the time I was 18 and a family friend. Those losses hit me hard. I've had anxiety for most of my life. I rarely socialized with people because my parents did not have time with me because of my brother. I was a freak. I got depression in 10th grade. My perfect record as a student was gone after that and I lost all motivation. My family in India thinks of my family as a black sheep so they all dislike me because I suffer from mental illness along with our family. They judge us but they haven't had to deal with mental illness. I mean who are they to judge. We went to India to see them, me and my father, and my uncle drunkenly said no one wanted you guys here but I convinced them to let you come. I've never felt so embarrassed in my life. We still had another week we were with them. My friend got raped when she was in college. I think she might hate me secretly. She had a girl she knew come over and they both got drunk. The other girl started puking and my friend started panicking. I told her to call two people she knew there. They didn't pick up and she said she was going to ask her neighbor across the hall for help. I didn't think twice and I said sure if you know him and you think he will help. She started calling me the next morning but I was tired of talking to her while she was drunk. She told me the next morning that she was raped by him. I've felt like scum ever since. Because I should have told her not to go. And my father had open heart surgery my senior year of high school. Just when I thought things would be going okay, I had to become an adult. I was depressed. Isolated. Barely any family came to help and I was seventeen. My uncle in the US came once a week to check in but no one was at the house full time. My mom was convinced my dad was faking and refused to help me or take responsibility. I started grocery shopping, driving my autistic brother to doctor's appointments, visiting my father at the hospital or wherever he was, I went to my part time job, and I started missing school. I would go in the morning, leave, and come back at the end of the day so it wouldn't count as an absence but an early dismissal. The attendance ladies knew me by name. My schoolwork started piling up. I couldn't see my friends because I had to be on call for my father or stay at the house for my mentally ill mother and brother. My dad had angry outbursts in public all the time but I was the one cleaning up the mess after him, convincing them he was harmless instead of a psycho. We also argue a lot. He tries to control me. He acts like he doesn't but he is slightly misyogynist. And he is unbelievably full of himself and at times displays little sympathy. He got so annoyed at me once while he was driving he hit me in the mouth while I had braces. It started bleeding so I screamed at him to take me to an ER because I was scared. He started arguing with me another day and I accidentally hit him between his eyes with a phone because I was trying to defend myself. I felt guilty hurting him and felt awful. I was just scared. I think I became sort of a monster. I started screaming and getting upset all the time. I would threaten violence or get very physical because I felt it was the only way to survive. On the day of my graduation, my dad and mom started screaming so I left for graduation in tears. My dad went because my friend's dad offered to drive him. He left halfway through and I waited half an hour afterwards to see if he would show up to congragulate me. He ended up going to dinner with the other dad and asked if I wanted to join him. All those empty promises from multiple family members saying earlier in my life that they would come stung. I ended up going to a school I wasn't going to go to because my dad thought it was more prestigious and it was closeish to home that I would be able to check up on the family. I hate it here. And I was so depressed and going home my first year, I failed to make friends. I am so lonely. And my dad said I could leave but then lied and said he didn't mean it so here I am in year 2. Still barely talk to anyone. My life should have been getting better, not getting worse. Now I can barely take showers. I don't have any motivation. I wasted two years of my life. My aunt and uncle live near me but they only talk when they need something. I have a car on campus. So they ask if I am going home one weekend to pick up some things. Or if could drive them to Walmart. Or if I can help them move. They left so late from their old apartment they slept in my dorm room so they wouldn't sleep in the lobby because I offered. But I know what they think of me. Because they never call otherwise. They claim it's because they do not want to disturb me but they know I don't have any friends. They told the people they were staying with that I wasn't their niece but I was a student driving them. I waited for an hr in the car eating fast food while they were packing up because I was only a student. I never even meet the people they are staying with. I sleep in a pile of trash everyday on my bed. Sometimes I don't sleep. Sometimes I sleep the whole day. Sometimes I miss all my classes. I wanted a sense of normalcy and instead I got this. I told 3 of my friends that I felt hopeless. But none of them take me seriously. I had one therapist tell me that I probably will not commit suicide so why bother talking about it. I told another at college but she said I am resistant to change and in that moment she was my last hope. I almost bought charcoal to kill myself but instead I cried the whole day and missed my classes instead. I am tired of keeping up this fake happy facade. I was only doing it for my brother. But it's getting too much now. I am doing all of the things you are supposed to do but it never seems like enough. ",sw,0,0.08,0.183

2100,"The Jelly Belly Jelly Bean Flavors: RANKED I am somewhat concerned as to how exactly Jelly Belly makes their jelly beans because typically the artificial flavor of the beans are SO strong that it is overwhelming. But necessary if you are eating a variety so that any one flavor can be completely erased from your palette when popping in the next.   My mom had got me a small box of jelly beans for Easter, a variety pack of conventional flavors, and I haven't really eaten these things in years so I thought I'd dip back into my childhood and try them out. Was interested to see that old favorites became today's garbage, and the flavors I used to be meh about have come to the top of my list. Because I’m kind of drunk and bored I will share list of favorite Jelly Belly jelly beans from the worst bean to the best:  * 20: Licorice  I have yet to understand who actually enjoys licorice. I understand back in the olden days there wasn’t as much of a variety of flavors so licorice candy maybe was tolerable alongside like star anise and such. I don’t know how different today’s licorice extract candy is to the licorice flavorings of yesteryear but it is abrasive and borderline obscene. I wonder if at the Jelly Belly lab, scientists did any form of outreach to have kids taste their beans to evaluate which ones stay in circulation. If they DID, then they would throw licorice out. However I have a hunch that Jelly Belly is one of the few corporations that even buy the root anymore and the licorice industry will surely die off without such a loyal customer. I would hate for licorice farmers to lose their jobs over the retirement of this bean flavor so maybe it’s for the best that this bean stays. The licorice jelly bean is as deceptively dark as the blueberry jelly bean so I would have to bite the bean first and get a hint of the horrid flavor so I could know to throw this one away. In hind sight, blueberry isn’t good enough to where this method was worth it. I should have thrown out all dark jelly beans for my own well *bean* hahahahahah get it? Ok,  * 19: Tutti-Frutti  When I was a young warthog, I used to love this fucking flavor. I’d single out the colorful bean and eat them all last, you know save the best for last and stuff? It’s a pretty thing to look at I’ll be honest, the pink with flakes of blue and red, a mini mosaic tile. Sadly, getting older, I’ve completely lost the taste for this hyper sugary flavor. It’s, it’s almost like bubble gum, a flavor I’ve also gotten sick of. I couldn’t do it honestly I threw these in the garbage as well. Thankfully easier to pick out than licorice.  * 18: Bubble Gum  No surprise there. But what IS a surprise is that these beans don’t even taste like bubble gum. Tutti-Frutti tastes more like bubble gum. This is just…off. Askew. It unnerves me.  * 17: Cotton Candy  The pink beans are also suspect and again I don’t know WHAT the hell they thought they were going for but it doesn’t taste like any cotton candy I’ve ever had. Isn’t that bad of a bean but the marketing kind of pisses me off  * 16: Very Cherry  “Very” should be replaced with “Violent”. Yeah, that is a better adjective. This bean is VIOLENTLY cherry flavored. In the jungle, bright colors on animals are sometimes a warning sign of poison or toxicity. I should have recognized the literal red flag that is the overwhelming Red of this bean. Seriously the color is concentrated redness. But of course, artificial cherry candy flavored, and so it kind of made me think of cough syrup.  * 15: Blueberry  Similarly, this is…violently blue. Not blueberry, this bean doesn’t taste like a berry. It tastes “blue”. Didn’t think blue was a flavor? Think again. The Jelly Belly scientists have found a way to extract the flavor of Blue and condense it into jelly bean form. Is it worth it? It’s ok I guess, but off putting.  * 14: Watermelon  A favorite summer moment is getting to sit out on the patio, feel the wind blow over me, and look at the trees and the vibrancy of the grass, and snack on grapes and watermelon. I like watermelon. This bean is not watermelon. I don’t know what actual flavor the artificial watermelon candy extract tries to emulate, but it is so far removed from the actual fruit that every bean I ate made me long for those summer days, for the juiciness and natural flavor of a true watermelon. I cannot wait for those days to return here.  * 13: Green Apple  What is with these fruit jelly beans? They are almost a mockery of the fruits which they imitate. Though it does taste very “green”, there is a bit more of a nod toward actual “apple” flavor.  * 12-8: The Citrus Fruits & Peach  Orange Sherbet, Sunkist® Lemon, Sunkist® Tangerine, Lemon Lime, and Peach all fall in the middle of the list because all are equally boring. Ironic because citrus fruits have vibrant flavors. Here I just feel meh. I feel so bored every time I’d pop a yellow or orange bean into my mouth, I’d think “oh boy I bet this will pucker the lips a bit” and I feel numbness inside of me because I think I am a grown man eating jelly beans alone in his room. I have nothing much to say about each individual flavor.  By the way? I have been calling “Orange Sherbet” “Orange Sher-bert” for years now. YEARS. No one has corrected me. I had to type “Sherbert” and get the red squiggly line to alert me that something was wrong.  * 7: Sizzling Cinnamon  The common theme you will see as I get closer to one is that for the most part, the more artificial the flavor is, the more I enjoy it. Which seems counter intuitive to me, I felt that as an adult I would like the fruit ones more. I think rather I appreciate when candy is trying to be candy, and not pretending to be fruit filled. The cinnamon one is good, makes me think of big red which I enjoy. Or like those mints.  * 6: Juicy Pear  An exception to the fruit hate. The actual bean looks a bit sickly, it makes me think of the booger flavored beans in Harry Potter. However, somehow, it works. Somehow, it does feel like a bite of a juicy pear. But better than a pear because pears themselves are somewhat boring, so the added sugar makes it higher on the list than most other fruits.  * 5: Strawberry Cheesecake  Impressionism was an art movement where painters would create scenes that weren’t fully fledged out in details, literally giving you an “impression” of a scene. More than that, it was their subjective impression of a scene as well. Similar traits can be heard in the music of Debussy and Ravel, who paint using music to portray impressions of Greek Myths, of foreign lands, etc. etc. I would say this bean is impressionist. It clearly isn’t a cheesecake. But you get the hint of strawberry, you get the hint of the dessert, and it is almost into the uncanny valley. Something is off, but it’s ok. This bean was probably crafted by an artist.   From this point forward I’m willing to say these beans are more examples of Impressionism in food art.  * 4: Coconut  The last fruit in the bundle and it’s the best. The white bean is a treasure. So simple, and calming, like white foam over the waves, like sand, like, well, a coconut. Biting into this makes me think of sun lotion, of being by the pool, of taking in the warmth of the sun. A bite-sized vacation.  * 3: Pina Colada  This will follow Coconut in description. Eating the cocktail themed bean makes me think of Puerto Rico and indulging in treats I can’t normally get here at home, feeling more relaxed and happy to be away from it all. Another vacation themed bean.  * 2: Toasted Marshmallow  I don’t want to know how the Jelly Belly scientists were able to extract the flavor of toasted as well as marshmallow and make it work in a way that isn’t overwhelming. It is just right, just the right hint of toastiness and marshmallowness. It does make me think of campfires, of looking up at the stars, of shivering in the cold, ghost stories…somehow all of my favorite October memories as a child is recreated through one bean. Kudos.  And finally, the King of Beans:  * 1: Buttered Popcorn  I do not understand how this flavor got to the top of the list. From just the name alone, it feels like a warning sign. Saccharine, unnatural, wrong. But somehow, SOMEHOW, the genius scientists were able to make an icon of movie theater popcorn. And by icon I don’t mean like “the iconic well known flavor”, I mean how the Orthodox use it. An ikon is a depiction of God in art, and this bean is an ikon of movie theater popcorn. I don’t understand how they were able to make a transcendent flavor like this. The scientist, nay, artist, who crafts this bean, probably has a loving family, he or she is probably fulfilled in life, sleeps peacefully. If not, you deserve it sir or madam. You deserve the good things that happen in your life. The life, the light, the love in me honors the life, light, and love in you.  And so ends my time-killer for the day. I hope you…enjoy? This. Also? If anyone from the Jelly Belly corporation is carousing social media for marketing research or whatever, and the title of this post triggers you to read it, know that I will be ready to promote your beans on this site in exchange for a lifetime supply of the following flavors:  * Buttered Popcorn  * Toasted Marshmallow  * Pina Colada  * Coconut  * Strawberry Cheesecake  * Every Licorice bean in circulation  The last isn’t because I want to eat them, God no, but rather I want to save others from having to come across them.

2103,"Does anybody remember MP3Den.com? I think they were active from late 2002 through to 2007, but I guess that was just when I noticed they were gone.

My friends wanted in on it, so I started burning discs for them too (I charged them two bucks for an album so I wasn’t just throwing my money out). But for real though, does anybody remember this site at all? I remember the site looking two different ways. The first one had to have been around 2003-2004.

Later on, around 2006, the site got a bit more dark and “modern”? Lots of red and black, which reflected the time period well enough, considering that was the whole “emo revival” era. The updates were always fun to look forward to, but as time went on they got pretty weird. One of the owners (there were five) made updates telling us what artists and albums he planned to upload to the site (I assume he was buying physical copies and then ripping them to his computer?), but I think he made an update saying he was ending that “service”. He said it was to make it more mysterious and to keep us on our toes, but I think it was because he wasn’t buying CDs as much anymore. I remember that one of owners of the site always got strangely personal with his posts, often telling us home details that were sort of TMI. As time went on, the updates got sort of infrequent and shorter. Eventually it just came down to changes he had in mind that he’d express in one word sentences, sorta bullet point style.   I think we started pissing off the main guy who updated by badgering him about the watermark on every single song. Like seriously, who does that? He did, and it was always a hassle to cut it out before putting it onto disc. Lots of users didn’t have the technical knowhow to splice it out, but the guy insisted it was important on keeping the “intellectual integrity of the site” (ironic, considering it was bootlegging, right?) I was young back then, so I definitely didn’t know how to remove them. Eventually I learned to more or less drown them out, and I’m sure those CDs I made, if any of them are still around, are riddled with that stupid, shitty techno watermark. I swear it’s almost ingrained in my mind nearly 15 years later. It said “www.mp3den.com, experience it”, as I recall. The voice was strange, and it was pretty obvious that it was pitch shifted down. It also wasn’t professional at all, and it was pretty obvious it was one of the owners who made it. I’m sure if you look hard enough, you could find songs on youtube with that same exact watermark. If you do, let me know!  The forums were always fun, I made a few friends on there. I became close friends with one of the owners, he was always really chill. Occasionally you’d have the people coming along and calling heresy on the whole site, shouting about how bootlegging was illegal, but they got banned pretty quickly. You’d also have some guys trying to advertise their own mp3 site, but they never got much attention. I remember a few times there were guys who wanted to put their own music onto the site and they immediately stopped responding once one of the owners pointed out that they wouldn’t be getting any royalties from it. One guy went so far as to make as many fake accounts as possible and spam the forums hating the site, but they all got banned and eventually he got tired of it.  Looking back on all this, the site seemed shady as hell, but I certainly had a lot of fun on it. I’d really appreciate it if anyone could give me more info, or even their possible memories of the site?",cc,1,0.095,0.092

In between those two points of my day, I am wracked with anxiety to the point that I cannot breathe normally, my heart feels like it will explode and I cannot think clearly. At least 4 times a day my thoughts start to race and they feel out of control. They often enter paranoid and irrational territory. I have been drinking more lately, a lot more, in fact I spent from 9:00AM to midnight this past Sunday intoxicated. I have been going out and drinking so much that I do very embarrassing and dangerous things, and sometimes only have vague memories of doing those things. Speaking of vague memories, I feel like I am losing the ability to remember things. Each yesterday seems made up. Or I have a thought, and I cannot remember if I have already expressed it. I wish I had a better way of explaining that, but just imagine that literally every 10 minutes, you can't remember if anything you did before ACTUALLY happened. This is all starting to take a toll on my ability to keep myself together for work. I work as an administrator for a preschool, so I need to be on top of my game and at least seemingly cheery for 9+ hours a day. Recently my coworkers have been asking me if I was okay, implying that it seems like I am on some sort of drugs because I talk... Weird? I guess? Like if my guard is down I don't make sense and slur my words, or I am talking very loudly and very quickly. If I am focused I can talk fine, but if I just clocked out or am not around students it's like I cannot will myself to interact regularly. My sleeping is all over the place. I either go 3 days without more than a couple of hours of sleep from staying out, or I come home after school and sleep for 14 hours a few days in a row. Regarding medical background, the last medication I was on was lamictal, which was months ago for mood regulation. I was hospitalized once back in 2013 for a suicide attempt, and have since tried most of the major antidepressants which either caused me to rapidly cycle or didn't work for me. I don't have money to see a doctor right now (or at least I dont have the mental capacity to make money management happen to visit a doctor) and I am terrified of having to go on new meds, or worse being hospitalized again and risk ruining everything I have built over the past 5 years. I live a state away from my family, currently don't have any friends close by, recently split from my SO, and feel super isolated. I WANT to die, but I know I'm not supposed to feel that way. So what do I do with this? Where do I go from here?

I don't think I need to address to anyone else because I have few enough contacts outside my family that people shouldn't miss me too much when I'm gone.

It helps since I had no idea what else to write about and I was saving this post for when it actually was the 50 days to graduation.  Just like 50 days ago, my school is having a small celebration for the seniors for the countdown to graduation. I won't be able to attend it though because I'll be at the fitness center hitting legs at that time; but it is nice to know that the end is so much closer (and also terrifying because I have a lot of catch up to do with my work this semester). In 50 more days I'll be walking across a stadium stage and shaking my college president's hand, looking forward to never sitting behind a desk again.  A year or so ago I had an idea pop into my head that when I hit the 50 days mark to graduation I should do something special and I have been preparing for that the last couple of weeks. You lovely folks get to hear about it first.  I rarely if ever post on Facebook. However, over the next 50 days I am going to write a special shout out to the 50 people/groups that matter most to me and have helped me along the way to get my college degree.   I had no idea how difficult this was going to be. I made an excel sheet to keep track of everything and as of now I only have 16 more people to write my thoughts about. I saved all of them into separate word docs. Those 16 people wont be for another couple of weeks though so I have time to collect my thoughts on them.  There have been a few challenges with this. I didn't realize at first that there weren't 50 individuals I wanted to write something about. It took me some time to get a whole list together of all the individuals/groups of people I wanted to write about. The next issue was finding the right words to use when talking about each person. If that individual has a Facebook I am tagging them and writing most of the post in second person as if I was talking to them directly, but if they don't or if it's more of a group then I am using different language. I also don't know how much to share and not share about a person. I'm trying to keep the posts relatively close in length but some people I just know better and thus will have a larger post.  I'm afraid that some people will be upset if they don't get a personal post, but I also have a few posts dedicated to collective groups (all my XC teammates, the honors program, my relatives, and one or two more) that just about everyone I know will fall under something.  I know that this isn't a very important thing to do, but I've heard many times before it's best to give people roses while they're living and so this is exactly what I am trying to do. I want to show those who matter to me that they do. For the friends/family without Facebook I plan on sending them the post somehow so they can see it.  Sadly, I can't do that for my first person (who is getting today's post) because it is the librarian who was at my high school that I lost contact with after she got a new job. Without her, I wouldn't be where I am today. I hope somehow I can at least find a way to email her my thank you.

I have decided once and for all to end it thanks to today's event which acted as the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. Long story short, a girl I've been speaking for many months now, whom I like and who likes me, a lot, has spent that last four months trying as hard as she can to avoid seeing me and talking to me so that she can get over her feelings for me. Whenever I ask her why she can't just let me take her out, she'd always have a reason why a relationship is not the right step for her and that based on her past relationships, we would focus to much on each other and begin doing bad in school. Because of this, despite the fact that I live one street away, she refuses to see me. It's been 4 months. We haven't had a decent conversation in 1 and a half.   After all this time, she met another man at the bar, one of her drinking buddies, whom she is falling for and is over me.... which is what she wanted from the beginning. She didn't want those feelings for me to be there. I don't know why. Why am I poisonous? She has no problem seeing this other guy almost every day and violating almost every reason she had for not wanting to see me. I am a fool. I am a fucking fool. On top of that, the emotional abuse and trauma as a child, the family ostracization from childhood to adolescence, my grades spiraling out of control at that time, my brother passing away, my friendships being facades that were manipulated only to use me, my relationships that were only to toy around with me.  I've decided a long time ago that I wasn't meant for happiness in this world, but I think now, I realize that maybe its not just that I wasn't meant for happiness in this world, maybe I myself wasn't meant for this world.  I don't want to die, I just want to not exist anymore. I wish I can one day just be walking down the street and have a car just come and hit me. I can't think of anything more beautiful.

2145,An honest review of the Purple Pillow I tried posting on their website but it was removed so here’s my honest opinion. I received this pillow 3 weeks after my birthday because apparently it takes 3 weeks to package and ship it. So after 1 month here you go.   Pros: Helps me sleep.  Breathable mesh causes air to gently blow on you when you move.  Extremely comfortable.   Cons: Has a funny plastic smell.  Weighs about 10 lbs.  Tends to get hot in the center even with the breath ability.  Is very flat so I have to stack it on another pillow.  Is 100$ but should be about half that.    Overall I’d give it a 3.5 pillows out of 5. Will this be the perfect pillow for you? Probably not. Would I rather just buy one of the 5$ puffy ones from target every 6 months? Yes probably.

Simply a pen, has broken me. With mind racing in anger, I leave the card blank, My little shit of a sister only gives a damn about the money anyway right? I exit and the wall of safety breaks away as I am exposed to the ridicule and mockery of my own family, The thoughts, my own of death and freedom give way once again, How can I keep living as a rock for people to dump shit on and get moving. It just doesn't seem fair, I have nothing to outweigh the burdens of others. Back in the present, My anger is seen as unjustified, therefore I am in the wrong. Why do I have to hold on where others can break down?  This is my morning, variations will occur. But this is my life. I have not mentioned nor stated any other events which have or did occur prior throughout my life. Please help.",sw,0,0.089,0.154

So, my job basically just told me I'm wasting my energy and creativity working on side projects (like game development and modding) and that I should be focusing all of my effort on my real job because it ""matters"". The thing is, I don't think my job matters. What they do is important, sure, but anyone with my education could do what I do. I'm a glorified number cruncher here. That's not important. The stuff I'm working on off the clock is stuff that's truly ""mine"", and I think that makes it important.  I requested to switch to part-time because honestly this job is causing me weekly anxiety attacks and I can't stay here for eight hours a day five times a week without breaking down and I'd rather use that time to work on my own stuff. I was told that I was hired to bring that creativity to the office and that I shouldn't be wasting time on things that are ""fun"".

I also have PTSD. Right now, I don’t think I can function in normal society. I keep trying, but if I’m Manic, I make shitty life choices and ruin my life. If I’m depressed, I will try to kill myself (three times and counting). So, when I’m manic, I take a light dose of Benadryl to dull my brain. When I’m depressed, I take a heavy dose to sleep so I don’t kill myself. Like, this is where we’re at right now. I’m self-medicating just to survive.  Obviously I’m not on real meds yet. My therapist has this stupid as fuck “well, let’s wait and see” approach, and waiting and seeing is totally ineffective. I think she’s afraid I’ll try to OD, but my best friend is a psychiatric nurse and would help keep me safe from myself for as long as it took for me to get “balanced”.

2215,"a stupid fucking rant Sorry if this comes across as a jumbled mess but i need to vent, ive been thinking of and looking forward to dying more and more and more lately. I've been depressed since around 13-14, it usually comes in waves lasting a couple of weeks every few weeks and i've coped with it reasonably, starting to smoke weed was the biggest help in years. Then i started working, at first night shifts that paid decently and didn't have much interaction with people. I could put my earphones in and work through the night, but the longer i worked there the harder it was to keep doing the same tedious grind night after night. A couple of years ago I moved to england with my partner while they study at uni. we both work in different retail jobs as well to cover rent and other bills. She has a promising future in her field and i'm happy for her, but I have no prospects aside from more retail. I work 4 days a week in 8 to 10 hour shifts and this already is more interaction with people than I can take without being completely mentally drained and left utterly fucking depressed by the end of each week with just enough respite to force myself through it again. Since starting this job my waves of depression have become longer lasting and closer together, I've been drinking heavier and heavier and now i drink at least 70 units a week, by the end of my shift it's all i can do to numb myself and quiet the mental loop of ""this is your life, you'll do this ten thousand times over before you have any hope of retiring"". At this point i just want my liver to give in already, my hope is that once i have the finality of a slow painful death in front of me then i'll finally have the motivation to actually kill myself quickly, until then I'm just becoming even more miserable and angry every fucking day. I've always tried to be rational and not assume the worst in people but since starting my job in england i can feel myself becoming increasingly racist and that only makes me hate myself even more. I dont want to say that all middle eastern people are assholes but every single fucking piece of shit customer that seems to have woke up that morning with the sole intent of finding me and being as huge a pain in the ass, as rude as fucking possible and outright fucking retarded has been middle eastern. the more i deal with them the more stereotypes i see apply. today i chewed my gums to the point of blistering trying not to scream at yet another middle eastern customer who was doing the typical ""suddenly i don't speak english"" routine. I dont know how much longer i can keep doing this before I stop trying to drink myself to death and just put a broken bottle in my throat. what the fuck am i supposed to do when i have no ambitions and im too fucking lazy to put the effort or time or money into some form of higher education that i'd only burn out and fail at? most of my days off i can barely force myself out of bed even after hours of lying awake, several days i feel like im fucking paralysed from the neck down until 2 or 3 in the afternoon when my body finally responds and gets up. i didnt want to be born and i dont want to go through death but i dont fucking want to exist. rant over i guess, wish i could say it felt good to vent but i only feel worse, at least i stockpiled drink for the weekend by my bedside so i dont have to walk to the off license.  if your family has a history of depression dont have kids, dont fucking do this to someone, it's cruelty to create a life knowing damn well they'll only want it to end.  sorry for the shitty formatting and generally fucking stupid nonsense ranting, guess i cant even fucking vent right",sw,0,0.063,0.201

At the beginning I didn't really have a purpose of posting other than just archiving what I thought were my cool matches so I didn't lose them. Eventually I started have a pretty big collection of content but still no one was really watching and I don't particularly blame them... It was a random dude playing a game at a pretty mediocre level.  The latest version of the game came out a little more than two years ago and I have been posting matches as I leveled up. In all it's nerdy glory, I have reached Diamond rank in SFV. Not an incredible feat for thousands of players but at the same time, it means I am in the top 2% of players in the world.

I believe it was when i met my now wife at 19. I came to the conclusion that we were meant for each other and we both had responsibilities to make sure we had a decent life together.  I quit my part time job and got a new one working full time 40 hours/week.  It wasn’t easy at all, but I think that is what separates me from my generation.  Nothing you want in life is ever going to come easy.  We rented out a room for $700/month and we both saved up as much ad we could. We didn’t go out to eat, we didn’t buy fancy new smart phones, and my gaming addiction abruptly ended.  I spent a little bit of my savings to go to school, and get my 2 years associate degree, which i used to get my career at 24 years old. She saved up to buy a car.

Instead, every day death and heartbreak swallow my soul a little, suffocating me into a homebound life that’s not very far from death, or at least not living. I’m barely functional and haven’t been for years. I’m not sure I could actually work the full-time job I need to find to survive. I can’t seem to find one more classic to get my college degree. I keep telling myself that there are things to look forward to in life, but I can’t find anything more to look forward to. I don’t get any more family memories, my siblings and grandparents are dead. The rest of the family is lucky to see each other every few years or less. I don’t believe I can ever get my college degree. I’m not sure I can even get a fucking job, let alone have a decent career. My head is hell and my health is shit, so I”m not sure I could have a baby, let alone raise a child of my own. I think I”m destined for lifelong familyness, not having a family ever again.  I basically have no religion anymore, I don’t think I believe in a God or eternity though I did as a kid. My childhood family was extremely religious, so I feel alone in my agnostic views.

I”m insecure and feel unloveable, like no one would want to marry me anyway. I’m on the autism spectrum, and I have one friend. One. I can’t afford to Uber/Lyft to go places, so I can’t “go make new friends.” I can’t physically drive. My city is very surburban and very spread out, there’s no bus and it’s not walkable. I can’t afford to move anywhere. I don’t have health insurance so I can’t get treatment again for depression, anxiety, ADD, OCD, etc.   I am, was, a college student. I just graduated a certificate program at one school this semester, but lack my bachelor’s degree from my old tier 1 school by one class. One fucking class that I can’t do. So I have no idea.

Ever since that one individual (I didn't know them, I just found them online.) asked me to read to them, I had done it ever since. Since I suffer with insomnia, I thought why not make use of my time.   I would make a post online and wait. On average each night I would read to about 3-5 people until they fell asleep. I was able to do more if I had enough time that night. On average, it took about 15 minutes or less for people to fall asleep. I enjoyed reading and these people and they enjoyed being read too, needless to say it was a win win.   As I got older, I decided to diversify and start sending goodnight messages to those who wanted one (voice messages). This proved to be quite popular, it wasn't until a few months later that I realised how much some people really appreciated a 30 second message wishing them goodnight.   After doing this for several months I began to get ""regulars"" I didn't mind and we managed to find a schedule that suited nearly everyone.

The thing is, in the *CDMX* and the *Estado*, we serve them with a lot of different fillings, such as *chorizo*, *chicharrón prensado*, chicken, etc., whereas in most of Mexico *quesadillas* are *always* filled ***with*** cheese and **very** occasionally with something else. That's the thing that bugs most outsiders and some *capitalinos*; basically, the debate divides in ""las quesadillas a huevo llevan queso"" (that is, ""if it doesn't have cheese, it ***absolutely cannot***  be a *quesadilla*) and ""las quesadillas no siempre llevan queso"" (""it doesn't ***necessarily*** needs cheese to be a quesadilla"").

I’ve recently unsuppressed memories of my neighbor tying me up and raping me. It took me a month to come to terms and tell my parents and when I did they said I was being over dramatic and because we were kids it didn’t count as rape. It was just “discovery” and every child does it but I promise you this was not ordinary discovery. I’ve heard of people just being curious so they ask their friend if they can see their genitals but this was nothing like that.  After I told them I was suicidal they said I was being a coward. That that was a selfish thing to think about and gave me a rant saying how hard it was when my cousin killed him self. That just made me feel shittier. They’ve gone through stuff very similar to what I’m doing and are expecting me to react in the same way.  I’ve looked up to my parents for years. Always told them everything.

Like, getting out of here at approx. 8AM. I got there at about 10. And I don't know, during the trip me and my family had an argument. When I got there I watched some TV and went for a swim. But I spent like 1 hour just sitting on the pool stairs, thinking. And my mom went to talk with me. She was trying to tell me that I need to loosen up. But I don't know, I just kept trying to find reasons to not do so. I didn't even wanna go on the first place. Then, after I was done, I went to take a bath and spent the rest of the day doing nothing. Then, as night fell, I went to search for some bugs and found a few spiders and Argo, a grasshopper.

We had a barbecue, and when I went to get something to eat, the same guy gave me some skewed cheese, even though he knew the skewer was burning, he told me to pick it up. And I felt nervous, and my mom was yelling at me about it. When I picked it up, my finger burnt so bad, I practically hurled the skewer across the room. It left a pretty nasty burn on my finger. When I was going upstairs to be alone for a bit, I picked up an umbrella because it was reeeeal rainy and at that same moment the wind knocked a Bluetooth speaker down from a wood beam close to where I was.

My mom saw me looking at them and thought I was staring at her. Then she started staring back and got mad at me again. As I was heading to the bathroom, I overheard my mom saying ""don't mind him, he's retarded."" And I don't know why, but that really struck me. Then I spent like a literal hour under the shower, just looking at my steamy reflection on a giant mirror they had inside the shower box. After I was done, a really annoying kid arrived and started to piss me off. I was holding me back not to throw him inside the pool. He's here right now by the way, and every 5 minutes he comes to knock on my door. What bothers me isn't even the fact that he's knocking, it's the fact that he just wants to play with my stuff. He doesn't want me. I'm just a walking laughing stock for everyone, it seems. That's how I feel at least. Everything I do is funny to someone in some degree. I feel like an animal in a zoo. Like a dog, just entertainment on legs. At night, when I wanted to just lay down on the couch, I asked my mom's boyfriend ""excuse me"" so he could let me through. But I accidentally bumped into him and he thought I was just pushing him aside. We got into a really heated argument. You could touch the tension in the air. then I went to sleep and today morning was just... Awkward. Packing was awkward. Having breakfast was awkward. Everything was awkward. The trip home, that kid kept bugging me to play with my PSP, even though he was playing on his own phone. Now I got home, and I just stood sat on my bed, holding back not to kill myself.  I'm sorry if I sounded bratty or played the victim card, I just... Sigh I don't know anymore...  ",sw,0,0.076,0.1

As for myself my studies are going pretty well so far. I have submitted 2 assignments so far (and on time!). For those interested I am majoring in psychology, and this trimester I am taking social psychology and cognitive psychology. Two fantastic choices I think. Social psychology in a nutshell is about understanding why we behave as we do in front of other people, it is about group dynamics, stereotyping, close and intimate relationships. Cognitive psychology is about things like object perception, memory; how we acquire, store and retrieve information. And I am also doing criminology as an elective, it has been great so far!

I used to talk to my few loved ones about how I feel, but I've found that people get very tired of hearing it and that it in fact really hurts other people to hear it, so I try not to overshare.

At least I was lucky still that he took me back, I love him so much and he's gotten a great job where he's not stressed out anymore...  I had to quit my job because I got promoted and didn't get the option to be back to my lower position (it was less stressful), and now been like 8 months jobless.  2017, my bf's friend passed away from cancer...  2018, finally we could afford a small holiday to another state, we got back, we find out one of our cats almost died from a kidney disease, my last bits of savings to keep him going. He's healthier again and happy, and I'm glad I did it, but damn it, I know I should appreciate what I have, but I hate myself so much lately:  It's hard with my bf who isn't very emotional and we never do things together like watch a movie or anything, we just sit on our computers and talk to each other; I had a talk with him and maybe I got through him finally, but I just wish he would do something out of his way for me since I suprise him with his favourite snacks when he calls and has had a bad day, I listen to him every night complain about work, I cook and clean and I do pay for my own rent and bills since I have savings...  I'm just so tired of crying every night now, I called my bf's mother and wished her a happy Birthday, but they wanted to cut it short and kept asking about what I'm doing with myself...it made me feel baaad.

2461,"Waiting for temporary restraining order, scared in my own home. So last Sunday, the 25th of March, I [21 F] was at my local police station in NJ for three hours to get a temporary restraining order from my ex [24 M] who lives in Staten Island, NY. I was told he would be served within a couple of days and it’s been over a week now. He is still messaging me via social media on a fake account he created because I blocked all the other ones and he still sends random texts now and then in addition to the online messages. He made over 10 fake numbers off of texting apps to text and call me non stop and it’s still going on to this day. Yes, he has threatened my life and I have evidence of it BUT still no word if he has gotten served or not. I don’t know how much longer I can handle feeling scared in my own home and just dealing with this in general. It’s really driving me insane.   I went to court this past Thursday for the first time about this matter and met a lady from the Safe and Sound organization. She told me basically what I needed to do to get this rolling and that I need to get my order amended because there’s just not enough information on the order itself. After my name was called in the court room my case was put off to the next week, Thursday, April 5th, and the lady from Safe and Sound gave me some info about the organization and took me where I had to go to get my order amended. However, I couldn’t stay longer than I did that morning because it was such a last minute thing and I had other things I was supposed to do. So, I am going back to the courthouse today (Tuesday, April 3rd) and try to amend my order.   I called my local NJ police station to see what’s going on with him being served and I was told to call the 800 number on the report. So I did that and the man who answered said that, that service was not available in NJ. I also called the Staten Island Police station and they told me that my local station should have that info BUT my local station didn’t help me the first time I called. The officer who I talked to from my local station said to maybe call them back in the morning about it but I just feel so.... helpless and just a “why am I even bothering” feeling.

My mom and I finally figured out a schedule so I can finally get a job again while needing to care for my grandfather so I’ve been going to interviews.

2487,"I'm a survivor of sex trafficking. I want to die. I reposting this to this sub because I haven't managed to find a person to actually talk to and open up to. But yeah, I feel weak and like I can't manage things anymore.  I just feel defeated. I'll start with the basics. I'm 18, I've been through a lot in my life and I recently got out of it yet today I seriously feel just as defeated as I was in my lows of lows.  I was grabbed off the street while walking home from school when I was 15, forced into sex trafficking and was abused in every single way imaginable. I've seen things that you don't even dare to imagine are true. I was getting raped, used, drugged, mutilated, beaten half to death, treated like an object and shit that's even worse on a daily basis. I had to survive being sold to the worst people on this planet. I had to not fight back when these disgusting freaks put their hands on me. I had to just lay there and take it. With every monster I had to deal with, I lost a part of my soul. to the point where I literally just feel empty now. I had to feel the pain of being raped 5 times a day. having thoughts about whether I was gonna make it through the week every day. And the thing is, After all of this I believe them. I believe that I am a piece of sh*t worthless loser. I see myself as fat and ugly. I can't look in the mirror. I hate waking up in the morning, I hate going to bed at night.  I've been out of there for a few months. The first few weeks were fine, But then it just went downhill. I literally hate my revolting ugly reflection. I hate my past. I hate that I can't close my eyes without feeling like someone is gonna walk in and rape the shit out of me till I bleed out again. I just don't feel anything. I feel empty. worthless. pathetic. I don't know if any of this makes sense but after everything I just started feeling like I don't even have ownership of my body. It just been used by so many freaks that I don't even want it anymore. And I don't think anyone will even find me decent looking. I'm disgusting and I'd rather just be dead.  After I got out I honestly tried getting my life put together but now I'm just back to thinking about giving up. I honestly don't see the point in trying anymore. I put all my energy on doing the state test, which I failed and I'm redoing in 2 days. I put all my energy on finishing my high school diploma and I managed to pass everything except math. but that only means I have to retake math hence I won't be able to apply to colleges this year. which only makes my parents more disappointed and pissed at me. My parents don't know me anymore. They expect me to be the same kid I was when I was 14. and in addition to that they expect me to be able to pick myself up and move on in life flawlessly. and they're right. I did want to go to college this year. I don't want another year to be alone with my shitty thoughts.  I got out of all of it, but everyone that's still stuck there couldn't. I had to endure living in a place where if I wasn't something customers wanted, I'd be offed without a second thought. I was getting raped to the point of passing out. I had to deal with the worst of humans. including pedophiles and fucking cannibals. And I got out. and I'm aware that others didn't. And I know I should be grateful. but all I feel is bitter, disgusting and suicidal at this point.  I hate myself. Everything about me is disgusting and I should honestly just slit my wrists the way I was dreaming of doing throughout my time in that hellhole. And I'm sorry again for this not having some inspirational or happy ending. It's just honestly where I am right now and What I'm feeling.

I was hoping that this series was never going to end, but I guess this is my last go at Sharknado.  I thought the idea of the movie was stupid when the first one came out and I had no interest in watching it. A month or so after The Second One (the actual title of the movie) came out I decided I might as well watch this garbage. I absolutely loved them with how bad they were and I was so disappointed that I didn't watch the first movie when it originally came out because I could've had the chance to be in The Second One as an extra since it was filmed in NYC. The third movie came out on my birthday the year it was released and that was the best birthday present I had. The fourth one had absolutely no plotline and was just filled with cameos that went over my head. I went to a bar with my best friend for the fifth one because we heard there was going to be a viewing party of it but we ended up missing the first half hour and the viewing party was just us and the bar tender; I have to rewatch that one before August.  I am so hyped though for the sixth movie cause it's gonna have time travel and who knows what else (I'm not reading anything about it so I can be pleasantly surprised when it comes out).  I know Sharknado is ripped apart by everyone, and I can totally understand it; but that doesn't take away from my enjoyment watching these movies. I hope I can find a legit viewing party in the city for it when it comes out (and if not I will throw one myself).  What's something that you were sad to see come to an end?

2521,"Cancer and Autism and ruining me Alright , so where do I start? Well first of im a 16 year old boy with high functioning autism since birth. Im currentlyy 153 centimeters , which makes me a center of bullying. I am currently in grade 11 and have been bullied ever since grade 6. There wasnt a single year where I didnt visit the school director and/or counsellor because of me getting bullied. Nothing changed that I even had to move schools. Its highly noticeable I had cancer due to the multiple scars on my head, my height being another point of my bullying. I hate myself. I cry almost every day because no one understands me , in fact im crying right now. I dont know what to do , I am embarassed of having had cancer, specifically I had brain cancer. Since birth I was in hostpital till the age of 3. When I turned 8 it returned but was able to be controlled. I hate myself so much I dont care if it returns i would die any day of the week . I used to have a twin brother at birth but he sadly didnt make it (due to the cancer killing him which does make me sad , I wish I would have died not him) A small background story, when I was born the doctors said everythings fine, only my parents knew it wasnt. Uncle? Aunt ? Everything bullshit they always told my parents that Im not worth it, Ill never be normal I shouldnt deserve to ruin their life. Only my parents believed in me. And the only ones right now to. I have no family except them, and when they are gone, my family is gone. I managed to enter hospital a day before it 'would be to late' according to doctors but I wished it was to late!! I feel like I ruined my parents life, their family and they sold their house and everything for me to be alive because the health insurance didnt want to anymore. My mom almost got sentenced to prison for life due to illegal cancer treatment in Germany (so we went to Asia to do it but due to my german citizenship she almost lost everything for me to live) . I cant stop crying knowing what my parents did for me: Now to my autism, first of I dont have the autism where I cant really control myself. I can like i dont scream or so. However autism is difficult, I feel left out from everyone and everything. Even if I regonize it and remind myself of it,I will still struggle to speak and so on without even noticing. No one understands how I struggle with Autism everyday, especially with all the jokes people make about it or people with it ; I always hide my autism because I hate it. Im embarassed.  Lastly my height, nothing that can be done. Doctors said hormones impossible now its to late. Before the risk is to high I get cancer again and if I do they will end up in jail and my parents aswell. I will always be small. I wake up everyday thinking why I cant be like others. I just want to be taller. Like normal people. But im not normal. And no one accepts that. As said before it does cause alot of bullying the older I get.  Not trying to trigger , but I just dont commit suicide because I believe in god. And that he forbids it because there are millions in even worse situations. Normal people at age 10 do what? Well Im sure they didnt try to stick a knife into their chest to kill themself. (I remember exactly taking the knife it just the pain that stopped me) I legit dont know anymore. I cry for years , I know im not normal and not even my family accepts that. Its fine. I just want to die but my parents did all this for me I cant. Whats the chance of all this : cancer , high functioning autism and so small. wow . Im a burden and a mistake in this life I just want to die thats it.  I can atleast be thankful for me talking and walking, because the doctors never thought I will be able to do that. Heck I could just walk at 6 and overcame full blindness at 5 . Right now I have a lazy eye which does ruin me alot aswell. Efforts to fix it for 3 years proved unsuccessful.

At that time I wanted to be a *badass cool kid* but I was far from it. On this particular day I decided to teach myself how to crack my knuckles. I figured it out pretty easy and haven't stopped since. I actually crack my knuckles three different ways now on my hands. The first is by balling up one hand into a fist and pushing against them with the other hand. The second is by doing the same thing but instead of having my hands in a fist, my finger tips are against the bottom of my hand [like so](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/14/Crack-Your-Knuckles-Step-6-preview.jpg/550px-Crack-Your-Knuckles-Step-6-preview.jpg). The third is by grabbing each finger individually and pressing against it sideways. With my thumbs I'll just crack them by pressing down on them with my other fingers and then wiggling the top part while squeezing against my other fingers until the other knuckle cracks.  My hands aren't the only thing I crack. I can also crack my neck by pushing against my chin in both directions. My left shoulder by lifting up my left arm above my head and basically punching the air to the right. Sometimes my right shoulder by squeezing it in towards me. The left side of my jaw by opening my mouth and moving it in to the left. The back of my knees (repeatedly no less) by bending and straightening them. My back by twisting my body. My ankles by rolling them around. And my toes by squeezing them. Sometimes I can get my hip to crack my standing a certain way. Occasionally some other body part will crack accidentally and I'm just like ""woah!""  I've looked into it, and this does not cause joint pain or arthritis.  When I get nervous I end up cracking the knuckles in my hands a lot more than usual. Same thing when I am bored.  Sometimes when I go upstairs the back of my knees will crack every step of the way. This might be a problem. It also happens when I do box jumps.   I know some people who are absolutely disgusted/agitated by the sound of people cracking their knuckles and if I remember someone doesn't like it I try to be conscience of not doing it near them (at least audibly because many times I can't help it).  Sometimes my mom calls me a bitch (jokenly) when I crack my neck or back and she can't.  Can you tolerate when people crack their knuckles?  Do you crack your own knuckles or any part of your body?  What are your nervous ticks?

2527,"Flying simulators (#95) Today my best friend and I went to the Intrepid Air and Space museum. I hadn't been there since I was still in single digits and she had never been. It was really cool walking around learning about military history and the different uses of all the vessels that the museum has. One of the features at the museum was a flight simulator where you had shoot down enemy planes. We bought tickets for that but waited until the end of the day to go to it (we had a really big lunch and didn't want to upset our stomachs, plus it was at the end of the museum).   After walking around for 3.5-4 hours we finally went over to the flight simulator and she got to see what it entailed: a lot of flipping and turning and all craziness. From the few times we've been to amusement parks together we've realized that her stomach can get unsettled on rides pretty easily. The entire time we were on line we were planning our route to the bathroom if she felt she needed to throw up. When we got on the ride the instructors told us that only one person can fly at a time and we can switch the pilot by pressing a button and end the ride with a different button. My best friend put me in charge of flying. I wanted to do all the crazy flips and turns and stuff, but I also didn't want to make her sick. I did some tricks and she was yelling at me, but it was all in fun. At some point I honestly had no idea how to turn us around to face the way we needed to go so I said ""You drive"" and I slammed the switch pilot button. Her controls were facing a way that we immediately flipped upside down and she quickly hit the button again and told me to fix us.   After all three minutes were up we got off the simulator without actually shooting down a single enemy plane. My friend actually felt fine and we were able to go through the last little bit of the museum with no problems.  I had done a flight simulator once before at the Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington DC. I was with a different friend and again I was in the pilot's seat.

2528,"It's April 11 Two years have passed since the things in my life really started to come apart. Fuck, man. I don't even want to admit to this but, shit, I'm not proud of myself for living through it all. It feels like walking through mud. I can make it to the end of the bog but I feel so horrible the entire time that I forget what my motivation even was to begin with. It's 12:25 now, ten minutes after I started writing this potmst because I put my phone down in the middle of it and almost fell asleep. I'm exhausted. I'm not any happier than I was at midnight on April 11th, 2016. A lot of days I just feel like a horrible person. Like the only real purpose I'll ever serve, the only thing I'll ever amount to is making people upset and making them hate themselves and me. It doesn't feel like two years, because two years is a long time to me and I really expected something to change for the better by the year 2018. If anything's changed at all, it's a change for the worse. It's fucking 12:31 now and my last recent Google search (aside from this subreddit) is ""reasons not to kill myself"". It's a good life.

2534,"I'm really feeling close to ending it... I just don't see a whole lot of reason to go on. First, there's my ongoing problems. A 19 year old who is depressed and never leaves home. I have no motivation or aspirations. They've all been drained out of me over the years and has been almost entirely depleted. And even then, I always wanted something outside of my abilities. I'm book smart, and that's it. Math, memory, etc. Stuff in the brain. But I never wanted that for myself. I've lost a lot of interest in video games. And I can't shut myself away and listen to music because my father won't let me. Complained it's too loud, but if I can hear anything, it defeats the purpose. Plus, he goes around with his monotone singing and he can hear his music and he doesn't care.  Which brings up a more recent point. My father has begun drinking hard liquor, a LOT of it. He's become emotionally abusive, insulting his kids, and his girlfriend (my mother), despite her making the sole income. And I don't like confrontation, so I just shut down whenever he gets in my or anyone else's face. My older brother kept him in check, but he has moved out.   I have nowhere to go. I didn't have any real friends in high school. Can't go there to calm myself. I can't get a job. I'm too anxious to go asking for one, and I'm prone to screwing things up. I usually just listened to music and kept to myself, but as I said, I can't do that anymore. I can't even go for a walk because I know I'm going to get scolded about that.  So, to sum up. No support, nowhere to go, terrible home situation, no longer any suitable escapism. I've been depressed since age 12, maybe earlier. I've getting the urge to just literally lay in bed and sleep. Because sleep is the only time I feel safe and okay. I've never committed major self-harm, but my will to live is getting consumed day by day. I don't think I have the courage to end it, but who knows? It's becoming more and more an attractive option... Can someone just... I don't know... What do I do? ",sw,0,0.089,0.11

We decide to head to Dunkin to get warm while we call the police when lo and behold, four policemen are sitting at a table at Dunkin (how ironic...).

2545,"I jist wanted to enjoy naptime Xpost     I'm on my throwaway. I just got a knock at the door and it's my complex handing me what I'm guessing is an eviction notice. Or intend to file or something. What the fuck ever it is, it says I haven't paid my rent this month. My mind goes ""uh, naw"" to ""I did right"" but no, I fucking did.      So I tell the lady no, I paid it on the second, I remember spending all weekend for the stupid balance to show up so I could pay it. I happen to still have the tab open when I checked to make sure it went through before the 4th when it becomes late because a couple months ago they tried pulling the shit saying I had a late fee balance (but not the rent because I paid it on the right day they just waited to process it). So I show her the tab where it has the date I checked 4/6 and shows my balance to be negative $3 and change, cuz I always make the payment a multiple of ten just cuz.      They say they'll call me.      So now I've checked and it didn't come out of my acct, no fucking clue why. But having thought I must've got my tax return I went and got new tires which I fucking NEEDED, driving on a donut and one with a fix a flat can. Just literally old fucking tires. I drive for work so I definitely needed a safe ride.       So now I decide to check on my tax return and it fucking says it's been taken to pay off a govt balance. I know exactly what the fuck it is. My goddamn military star card because I just got out of the army reserves two fucking weeks ago. So now what I was *going* to use to pay my late car payments and suddenly needed to pay rent to not be evicted is actually NEVER coming to me.       And here's where I want to give up. I just went through all this same shit not 8 fucking months ago. And then I got moved (not evicted, just they let me leave basically) to here, and working non-stop to catch up and my ex fucking sues me for custody etc. (Which btw he claimed her for last year despite her mostly being with me because I worked way too few hours last year).        I just can't help feeling like my daughter would be so much better off without me. Because I can't fucking do this shit anymore. Right when I get a handle, fucking 15 things come trying to fuck me in the ass. I don't really see any point for me being here. It's usually her that makes me want to stick around but if I'm fucking homeless I won't be able to have her. And if I ever we're to get myself back together he'd just use that in court to take custody.

2547,"Trying to figure out how to face another day So I've been trying to convince myself I'm OK but I can't keep up the charade any longer.  I've been living a ""good, respectable, responsible"" life for about a year now, but I don't know how to do it any more.  The problems in my life are so complicated and confusing regarding legal and family mess that I won't begin to try to explain my current situation.  Just know that it's killing me inside, and I've been trying my hardest to figure out solutions, and I just don't think there are any.  I've seen a ton of different p-docs and therapists, been on just about every combo of meds you can think of, and even been in inpatient care 7 times over the course of my life.  I finally just had to stop taking any meds, because they weren't helping.  Toward the end of my time on meds, the combo I was on was sedating me so badly that I kept falling asleep during the day and had no motivation, and my family berated me over how worthless and lazy and selfish I was.  Then, my doc changed my meds and I suddenly started having homicidal thoughts.  I gave up and quit all the meds.  And p-docs and therapists kept using my same-sex attraction as a symptom of mental illness or as a sign of downright moral failure.  (Yeah, I'm a lesbian.)  One doctor mocked me, one told me I was on my way to Hell, one told me he was good at ""fixing"" people like me, one ""crisis case manager"" even prayed over me and insisted that I study the Bible.  For my own safety, I have to hide my sexual orientation from my family and most people I know.  I'm 40 years old and haven't even so much as kissed a woman in nearly 20 years.  My life has been a jumble of abuse, rape, suicide attempts, self-harm, a home invasion involving two dudes with a shotgun, hallucinations, panic attacks, a few life-threatening health crises (aside from the suicide attempts), and the list just keeps going.  I look back and realize that there are large chunks of my life that I can't remember.  I see photos that I'm in or that I took and can't recognize them. Lately, more and more, the people around me seem strange and alien.  My surroundings grow louder and more chaotic every day, and everything seems to move faster and faster, and it feels like it's all coming toward me.  I start to twitch sometimes because it physically hurts me and makes my mind kind of short-circuit when all the sounds and motion and lights get to be overwhelming, but I have to try to suppress it because years ago a p-doc supposedly told my mom that I do things like that on purpose to try to get attention and pity, so my family can get really disgusted with me if they see it.  I don't recognize my own face in the mirror, I don't recognize my own voice.  Nothing seems real anymore, and sometimes I even feel sort of like I'm coming out of my body.  No, it's not drugs ... I have smoked marijuana ONCE in the past 16 years, and I can't remember ever doing any actual bad drug.  (And before those 16 years, back when I was younger,  I think I only ever smoked week 3 times altogether.) When I try to remember things in the past, my chronology gets all out of order and there are discontinuities and things that seem impossible.  In life and reality, in general, there are so many contradictions and absurdities, it just feels like reality can't be ... real.  I just want to escape.  I don't really want to be dead, but I want to be somewhere that makes sense.  And maybe there just isn't such a place.  And being where I am now makes so little sense that I feel like there's this unspeakable and eternal scream of wordless horror inside my chest.  Like, all the assumptions that we make about how reality works, about how things supposedly have some sort of order and reason and logic, I feel like maybe all those assumptions are just wrong and i feel like ""Reality"" could just BREAK any minute and then where the hell would I end up?  Maybe it's slowly breaking already.  Really, I think it might help to just have some quiet alone time for a while, get some rest, but I can't miss work, and even when I'm not at work, I'm dealing with my insane family,  and my home is so effing loud, and at work it's utterly insane because my company is falling apart and I'm expected to do the work of several people while still also being super peppy and convincing all our customers to buy a ton of stuff they don't want, and my boss is a terrible person who makes her employees miserable and I'm just so so so so tired.

2550,I have about a week before I get my first tattoo and I want to make sure it’s the right thing. I’ve always held off because I don’t want to get a tattoo that I regret. But recently it came to me that there’s two things I will always stand for and I may as well get a tattoo based on them if I’m going to get one. I’m almost 30 and I’m pretty sure this is what I want to do. It’s a half sleeve so I know for sure what I’m getting the first session but I’m still undecided about what I want to add the second session so I’m still thinking on that part.   I’m the kind of person that tends to overthink things so I Obsess about one thing at a time and won’t stop thinking about it until I know I’m going to do it the right way. Basically I don’t like to screw up.  Also I’ve researched tattoos online and one thing that scares me is that apparently some tattoo ink can get absorbed into your lymph nodes. There’s no known side effect of this but so many people have one and I never hear of any issues regarding this. So I don’t know how to feel about that.  Most people would probably just say hey I want this tattoo and go get it but I can’t do that.

I've been going through very expensive and invasive tests these last few months and we're finally starting to figure out what's wrong with me, and I'm finally on medication that helps.

At this point, we normally have a verbal tennis match rally; going back and forth like we're battling for the title at Wimbledon. In some cases we agree to a compromise such as, I will read to him or make up a story. He likes listening to me talk (I have no idea why, I sound like a stale French baguette - crusty!). He normally falls asleep to me breathing or chatting away, but before doing this protests that he's not sleepy and that I should keep assaulting his ear drums with my strange conversations.    There was a time where I was unable to talk to him for a number of nights, when we finally talked again he commented on how it felt weird sleeping without me. He also added that he likes when I fall asleep on the phone to him but especially when we fall asleep together and wake up and continue talking. (I have unlimited minutes, otherwise these long conversations would not take place. I'm a broke student nurse.)   Calling each night is mandatory, after showering and brushing my teeth it's on the phone to my friend.

Out of the many stories I told them there is one we will never forget!   The story is about a pair of siblings. A brother and sister. Their father was an astronaut. So one day he comes up to his kids and tells them he’s taking them to the moon. Before going to the moon the kids discuss what the moon must look like and they both come to the conclusion that it is made of cheese. But when they land on the moon in a day they realise they were wrong. They still enjoy their time on the moon and eat the Maggi noodles packed by their mom when they got hungry.   After an amazing time on the moon they come back to earth. One day as they were playing they find an unusual but familiar rock.  “This rock has fallen from the moon!”  The brother exclaims.  The kids discuss what to do with it for a while and decide they should go tell their father and take it back to the moon.   So they go back to the moon, again in a day. When they reach, they take the piece of rock they found and stick it to moon with feviquik (super glue) ",cc,1,0.105,0.032

Jumping into a wild animal exhibit at the zoo. Plunging a knife into my chest that I'm holding in my hand  And I try to put myself into situations where I can die without it being technical suicide I think.  An example i have is about 2 years ago when I was walking home from work late at night I saw this guy who was breaking into a van, I yelled at him and he pulled out a gun and instead of me running away I just sprinted towards him swearing and telling him if you shoot you better not miss and than he just started running. I caught up to him and slamed his head into the asphalt and called the police  Too this day I keep thinking about that night and I wish he just pulled the trigger I don't even care that I caught the guy to be honest I just wanted him to end it.

I've attempted several times, especially during my first and only semester at university. Since my early 20's though I've just been 'meh', Taking a detached feeling towards life.   I've never held a steady job, I'm legally unable to drive due to vision issues. I have many 'minor' disabilities, and I'm very overweight, I can't recall ever being at a normal weight at any age.   I guess part of my problem is that I judge myself before I let others judge me. I've always felt self conscious since I was in elementary school, that I have this awkward aura, or that people tend to overestimate my disabilities. I've always hated thinking of myself as 'disabled' since I'm not that disabled. The resources I'm eligible for should go to someone that needs it more.  Another thing I'm self conscious of as of late is how much I might be like my father (In prison since I was 8 for violent crimes I won't go into,) especially as my temper seems to be getting shorter the more I realize just how much of a general failure I am. I didn't have the best start, and I've made some shit decisions. I was a horrible person when I was a teenager.  Often I'm asking myself if I'm a decent person that's made mistakes, or if I'm a sociopath with a conscience, or something resembling a conscience.   I don't see the selfishness argument as one that often works, but I feel like I'm just here until my family ties all but disappear. I have a hard time seeing myself marrying or starting a family, let alone reaching old age.   Part of me just wants to go several thousand miles from here and do something new, though lack of driving ability, a degree in which to secure job opportunities abroad, and being broke in general seems to put a grinding halt on that.

We just enjoyed being around each other and it made every day fun.  Last year I graduated. I transferred to a university in the same town, but I had one friend move to a different state.

I don't get to see them very often as it is, and I miss these guys. We truly care about each other. I miss having that close connection.  Throughout the year I've realized that the friends i've made at my university is just no substitute for that. Since we all live in the same dorm there ends up being a lot of drama. Sure, I had drama in my last friend group, but it wasn't anything as common or petty as this. It's less of a ""I-want-to-hang-out-with-these-people"" type thing and more like a ""I-live-with-these-people-so-I-better-get-along-with-them"" thing. There's so much talk that I feel like if I make one wrong move or say something weird they're going to find me annoying and not want to talk to me. I understand that this in itself it incredibly petty and I realize that these people just make me self-conscious.  It's spring break now, and I'm thinking I'm just going to have to distance myself from all of my friends this quarter. We'll all be moving out soon anyways, so I might as well get used to spending less time with them. I was hoping to find a roommate for next year, but it might just be best that I go out on my own.

2795,"Suicidal - relationship breakdown I guess this is a scream for help.  My partner/ex-partner is asleep in bed next to me. 4 weeks ago, she told me she wants to leave me. We live together and there's been no arguments, cheating, abuse, anything like that.  She says she loves me but just isn't in love with me anymore. That her schedule (an insanely intensive postgraduate programme that regularly sees her busy 0800-220 or six days a week) has left her not having the headspace for anything else. I admittedly overcompensated for the feeling of distance this term and have got too clingy and anxious about wanting attention and time from her.  We've been talking around and around for a month. We had a week apart and she's abroad for 2 months solid on her programme at the end of this coming week. When she returns, she wants to move out. We live in an expensive city. I will lose her and my home that we worked so hard to build. I would be reduced to living with total strangers in rooms I can barely afford again. Back to square one.  But the real point is losing her. I don't care that it's a cliché. She is everything to me and I cannot ever replace her. I intend to kill myself if she still doesn't want me after having those two months away.   I have calculated everything I would need to do it, and intend to use 3 methods at once to ensure success. I've written a will, advance decision (but I need to figure out someone to witness the signing that won't give it away) and letters to everyone but her - I'll get to that last.   I'll be dead in our garage with instructions on our bed for her to call emergency services to collect me but not go in and not touch anything but her letter so as to not get her DNA on anything.  I don't know if I'm asking for anything. I don't want to die but living without her is more than I choose to so.  I'm already seeing a counsellor but that doesn't solve the actual problem.

2826,"Everything Feels Empty I want to get my story out there, so maybe this community is a good place to start…  I'm a 20 years old trans girl from Brazil. I've been suffering through depression and anxiety since I was a little kid, I've been told I was a mistake and worthless by my parents countless times even as a child… I had problems in school but instead of solving any of them my parents just beat me and threw me in a public school where I was beaten and bullied every day. Maybe the only friend I had back then was my brother, but we were distant in a sense since he has Asperger's… but we got along and watched cartoons together while our parents shouted to each others and shut doors down around the house.  When I turned 12 I was finally back in a particular school, a good one, but I didn't really perform well in it as my depression was already piling up on me even then… and all the matters and teaching system were way more superior than what I was used to… so I was basically performing extremely subpar… which obviously destroyed my self-esteem and I'd feel like a worthless disappointment.  Around 12, also, is when my gender dysphoria started to peak as a child… I'd cry every night wanting to be a girl even if I didn't know why it happened… it just did… and it stung even more that at school the girls wouldn't really even try to socialize with me… everyone deemed me gross and hideous.  15 years old came by and I was still in the same school, just high school, and my (late) puberty hit me… which obviously just made everything go even more downhill as I started to get more and more masculine… it was also very fat since 6… so I just got fatter. I was also doing extremely subpar in highschool… which, once again, still made me feel empty and worthless.  At 18 I miraculously entered the top university of my country for Linguistics (I'm not sure how, but I was called in the 4th wait list). It took me a semester of happiness, but things started to go back to as they were before… I got unmotivated quickly and noticed I chose my course wrongly as I was hating it… around that time I was also living by myself with my brother in São Paulo and even started my hormonal therapy at 19 in 2017.   Even if things were shitty in uni, I was still losing weight and becoming more feminine and I started to blossom socially. I'd attract people that were romantically interested, even went in dates and made friends in bars… but then… I was date raped one day.  I couldn't do much about it, the guy didn't leave any marks or bruises and there was no way to prove it happened, and I was also terrified to go go the police because I was still presenting male… and I know they'd not take a ""man"" seriously in a rape claim… and with how homophobic and transphobic Brazil is… I even feared worse…  So with that… I started to just stay home crying things off and spent months just in bed… I started to grow nearly obese again and my friends started to abandon me as ""I am too much of a bummer""… I also gad dropped uni…  After a few months… my really anti-LGBT parents caught up that I was on hormones and I was met with the ultimatum: stop it or you're out. The only thing keeping me together was over… in 3 months, most of the progress I had of 7 months of hormones were over as Testosterone is a really potent thing… so my gender dysphoria went even more severe…  Nowadays I'm just bed struck and have some social gatherings I go to… I can barely look at myself in the mirror and acknowledging my genitals literally throws me in panic attacks…  I'm now back on my hormones because I really don't care anymore… I'm just making things more bearable until I finally off myself… that is, if Brazil doesn't kill me first as my life expectancy as a trans woman here is 30… since this country is literally the most violent towards us in the world (even more than Iran… in Iran it's actually socially acceptable).

I get so sick and do so much damage to myself trying to work that I get to the point I just physically can't anymore. I'm applying for disability but even if I get it it will be well below the poverty line and not something I can sustainably live off of.  I've made it through these past 5 years because my at-the-time husband was picking up the slack as I tried to recover my health but he left me.

I don't see a way out of this. I'm not capable of supporting myself and I have no one I can rely on. I'm utilizing every resource available as far as assistance goes but there just isn't much. Housing assistance has a waiting list to get on the waiting list, both if which are estimated to be a year long so there is no reasonable expectation of help in that regard and I don't qualify for Medicaid because in my state you must be either pregnant, a single mom, receiving disability payments, or elderly to qualify so I have no insurance and my medical bills keep climbing.

You need an 80% to pass and only get 3 tries before you have to appeal to get into the major or change majors. It has 100 questions related to grammar, spelling, and punctuation.  I haven't studied grammar since elementary school and this test is stressing me the hell out. I'm having a hard time studying for it because of the lack of resources regarding the actual test.

2897,"Yep I'm not going to live through 2018. I used to believe I was a survivor, and for awhile I probably was. Also for any mods who think they're smart, I'm behind over 9000 proxies, so good luck.  Eight years ago I was diagnosed with PTSD. Four years ago I was diagnosed with cancer, and had to drop out of school to get a full time job to pay for insurance/healthcare. Cancer went into remission two years ago ironically only to lose my best friend shortly after. All the people who I thought cared or were my friends disappeared and dropped out of my life the second I reached out for help. The only resources that I have to reach out to now is a mental health system that honestly doesn't give a shit about it's patients. So as someone with way more experience than the vast majority of people who would recommend me to get help; fuck off. I have, and probably ended up more fucked up than when I first started getting help.  Mental health facilities are a fucking joke in the United States. The VA is useless when it comes to the treatment of PTSD, or any health treatment as far as I'm concerned. The vast majority of civi mental health units outside of the VA that I've been to (And yes, I've been to a lot -- over 10 at this point with some having multiple visits) are just glorified drug and alcohol rehab facilities that have a psychiatrist on staff that allows them to also accept mental health patients, as far as insurance companies are concerned, at least. While I'm sure this great for people with drug, alcohol, or dual diagnosis issues, this doesn't really help anyone else. Anyone who knows me will tell you I don't drink or do drugs (Probably the reason why I don't have anymore friends, to be honest). These places are not going to help people who legitimately only have mental health issues and need help. All they're going to do is take advantage of you, and your insurance, especially if you're there against your will. All you do at these facilities is sit around for 3-7 days being bored, watching TV (If you're lucky enough to have one in a group room), and going to one group a day that is patient lead since all the intern social worker does, who hasn't even graduated yet, just sits and listens, and doesn't really add much value to the groups. I've been to the one (And only) mental health unit in my state that is specifically for trauma patients, and while this unit was far more valuable than the others, didn't really help much because I found out that talking about my problems doesn't really do much for me. It also sent me off to yet another outpatient facility that was literally a drug and alcohol rehab facility because they had no where else to send me, and didn't want to release me without some sort of care. Thanks.  I have one of the most recognized psychiatrists in my region, but drugs only do so much. The only medication that has helped with the nightmares unfortunately also had the side effect of causing me to have more suicidal thoughts. Nothing has really helped with the flashbacks and panic attacks. The regimen of medicine that I've been taking consists of over 15 pills daily, and this is on the lower side of what I have taken in the past.  Last year I managed to break my neck, and pretty much destroy the right side of my body. That's not even the worst part. I somehow made a pretty good recovery. The worst part was when I realized the sad truth of where I was at in my life. When I was in the hospital, I had people I hadn't seen in *years* coming out of the woodwork to see me in the hospital all of the sudden. Where were these people when I actually needed them though? Where were they when my closest friend passed away? Where were they a few months after I got out of the hospital, and reached out for help to everyone I could think of? The worst part was realizing that people seem to only care when they can see you physically in pain. Apparently they could give two shits about me when it concerned any mental health issues.  I can't even remember the last time I had more than 3-4 hours of sleep. I'm having more panic attacks each week than I've ever had in my life even though I'm on more anti-anxiety meds than I've ever been on. The only people who seemingly care about me anymore are medical specialists my insurance is paying for me to see. I'm in more medical debt than I'll ever be able to pay off in 10 lifetimes thanks to said insurance refusing to pay for any of the surgeries required after my accident last year. I probably won't have insurance by the end of the year because I can't afford it anymore, so bye-bye psychiatrist and psychologist. And at this point with all this stress, I probably wouldn't be surprised if I died from some cardiac related issue before I could kill myself.  All the friends I ever had are either dead or not returning calls/texts, my family is pretty much fucking worthless. I'm mostly writing this in the hope that anyone recommending mental health units as a form of help to stop doing that, and do some research before continuing to spout of useless information to people who are already in a vulnerable position. And if you've gone to a mental health unit, and had nothing good come out of it, you're not the only one. So don't think it's you that's the problem as much as it's just the mental health system failing to actually help it's patients. There is far too much research being done in the pharma field, when there is an increasing need for far more research to be done on the neuro and psych side of mental health.

Every day I have bouts of anxiety or attacks at random. Whenever I start to get anxious, I do my best to notice that it's anxiety and just observe the thoughts. I accept them as much as I can. When things get to be too much, I use a CBT thought record to help reduce the attack significantly and It works. I meditate each day and do yoga each day. Yet, I still have physical pains that I know are produced by anxiety. (they go away when I'm calm and they never get worse) This morning, I was eating with my partner and my stomach started to feel discomfort and some nausea. It wasn't anything I hadn't eaten before.   Quick background: I had my gallbladder removed back in February because it stopped working. January was hell for me because I got really sick and lost 18 pounds in a month and doctors could not tell me what was wrong and why everything I ate made me feel sick. I had awful panic attacks daily.  So I was having thoughts such as: ""Is it happening again? Am I dying? Why can't my stomach function properly? Why won't this stop? Will I be at the doctor's all over again despite getting the all clear recently?""  I began crying and my partner gave me a hug and just held me and I felt better soon after. He went back to his house, and I'm feeling so low right now. I don't know what pains and sensations to report to my doctor about. They all come and go when they want. These panic attacks come at random and I don't know how to overcome them. I've done it once before through meditation, but it's back now.

I've cut off all my friends. I've been horrible to my family. I've put myself in a large amount of debt. I've allowed my teeth to rot and have showered less than 10 times in 5 months. I've masturbated incessantly. I haven't been able to leave the house without trying to pick up a hooker for a couple months. The day before my sisters wedding last week I went in my mom's room and tied a plastic bag over my head and took deep breaths for about 1-2 minutes just to see what would happen. I'm becoming a worse and worse person and I don't care enough to change myself. Last week my mom nearly choked to death in the middle of the night and I heard her and waited to see if anyone else was gonna hear her first. I waited like 2-3 seconds before going to try and help, just cause I'm so lazy and careless. And less than an hour after my mom nearly choked to death, I was watching porn and jerking off again. Now you tell me why I shouldn't kill myself. I don't care enough to change. Who knows what I'm capable of. I have a really bad temper and very violent thoughts. I have very strong sexual impulses.

Reasoning through my issues isn't helping very much, either.  I guess a little background might help. I'm 28 and married, and I have a little girl. Not too long ago I was in graduate school for school psychology, but the pressure of that program was so intense, and they frankly didn't know what to do with me. I'm hard of hearing, deeply depressed, and have struggled for over half my life with intense OCD tendencies and high anxiety... All of this translated into a clumsy, humiliating few years in grad school, and it felt like every kind of embarrassment I could suffer, I did.  After another person in my program committed suicide, I took it as an exit call. I collected a useless Master's degree and left.   Now I've taken a much lower-paying job locally, and more often than not, I flounder at it. Sometimes I think I'm inherently not good enough, other times I feel like I've failed everyone, and I'm not up to standards even when I'm feeling less depressed. It's never been more clear to me that I'm immature, moody, have no useful talents, and am not nearly as smart as I make myself out to be. And I genuinely don't believe it when people tell me otherwise. What is there to be happy about when you really think you have no worth?   How many times can I mess up before I have to recognize that I'm not worth anyone's time? How long do I have to stumble all over myself to realize I'm not useful? And does my daughter really deserve to have such a loser for a father? Doesn't my wife deserve much better than what she has with me?  These are the questions that I ask myself every day, in-between thinking about all my worst and stupidest moments, and planning the least intrusive way to end my life.   Sometimes, I wish it was obvious that no one cared about or valued me. I wouldn't have to think about any of this, I'd just kill myself quickly and stop my bitching...

Recently, I found my narcissistic husband cheating on me and kicked him out. Of course, being narcissistic he will never contact me again and never loved me in the first place. But when he went, he abandoned me with 3 kids and no way to support them, so I've resorted to selling everything I own just to get by. All furniture, all electronics, everything. Gone. I have nothing left to sell, and live in the middle of no where with no business within 65 miles to apply for a job at, and a crappy vehicle that can't transport me anyway. The thing that gets me about all of this is, I have good credit. I have always taken care of my bills, I have always treated people as well as I could and if I ever did treat them poorly I feel awful and apologize. I've been a slave for years and only stayed because I didn't know what else to do, but I couldn't take it anymore. Because I stand up for myself, and try to improve my life, it gets worse?

Recently I hung out with a few people from my grade who I don’t hang out with very often, and there’s this one girl who I’d say without a doubt is the most friendly and perfectly sociable person in my class. I’ve known for a while that she’s really nice, but after I got to know her more, I feel like I have to tell her. She is always smiling and is the kind of person to include everyone in the conversation. I decided that I want to tell her that I have deep respect and appreciation for her, because I’m sorta okay at conveying emotion and I really want her to know that she’s had a positive impact on my life. How could I do this without being too awkward or intimate? Thanks, everyone!  Here’s a little more info: We’re both teens in the same grade. We hung out a bit over the weekend for a school trip and now I know she’s genuinely a great person. I’m trying to tell her that I appreciate her, but I don’t want to come across as being too affectionate or flirty. I just want to be friendly and have an honest exchange of words. Also, she has a boyfriend and I’m not trying to interrupt that. I don’t see her much in school, only during band. She’s super modest and never acts like she’s above anybody else.

2998,"have you ever been in the state where you’re aware of your surroundings but also asleep? Today, during my state test, I was really sleepy and fell asleep multiple times. I was constantly doing the head bobble thing where you lean forward but then jolt back. So once I was done with my test, I took a nap because as still had two hours left.   During my nap, I was aware of my surroundings. I couldn’t really hear anyone because it was kind of like speaking into blankets, muffled sort of. I was aware I was asleep though and everything was black. The entire time, I was dreaming/ having nightmares. Every time I had a dream I wanted to end, I could end it but something new would appear. I remember having rapid fire dreams, one after another. I wish I was allowed to write on paper while others were taking the test but the dreams I could remember scared the living hell out of me.   The first one I can recall isn’t that scary, but I was having a conversation with a friend I really want to get to know better. He’s pretty funny and chill and in this dream we were having a conversation. I knew I was dreaming, but the conversation felt so real as if I were actually talking to him. I woke myself up by almost talking out loud and responding to him. I jolted and got up because I was about to respond to him. I can’t remember what we were taking about though.   Then these were the dreams that scared the hell out of me. It started off with my friend, well call her Gia. You know when your eyes cross and your vision duplicates and the opacity is kind of low do they overlap? I saw two of Gia in that way behind a black background. She was slowly morphing into different things, and it was all staticky and glitchy. It freaked me out, and as I mentioned, I could change my dream when I wanted to, so I did.  Then the same thing started happening to my friend, well call him, James. The same cross eyed vision thing happed, so I saw two of James. He was slowly morphing into different people, into a person that looked really familiar but I can’t recall who. But as James kept morphing I wanted to scream, I was on the verge of tears. Then I wanted it to end so I changed it. The transition between my nightmares were like a glitch staticky kind of transition.  This time it was me. I remember seeing demonic sounds. Which, sounds weird, like seeing sound, but that’s the only way I can describe it. Then eventually I kept morning into different things, but I kept changing at a rapid pace. So when Gia was morphing, it was really slow. Then when James was morphing, it got even faster. Then when it got to me, it was rapid, changing every two seconds. It ended with me looks like a cartoon sock puppet. Which sounds pretty funny, but after being in that sequence of dreams, it was horrifying. The idea of being not even human terrified me.  I ended up waking up in the verge of tears. I was so ready to just cry.   When the test ended, I got out my phone and immediately texted Gia and James about my dream. Gia then followed up with saying that morphing is one of her biggest fears, which scared me even more.   Have you ever experienced the in between state of being asleep and awake? Do you have any crazy dreams/ nightmares? If so please comment,, id love to know!",cc,1,0.147,0.086

I am in my final semester of college and just the other day I handed in the final check paying the last of my college tuition. No longer can I cross the street without a care and mentally chant ""Pay my tuition"" to any of the cars that drive by me. It's kinda surreal.  One of the factors that went into choosing my college was the fact that it had fairly cheap tuition. The price to be a full time (in state) student adds up to just a little over $6000 a year. This is actually cheaper than the tuition for the private high school I went to. I didn't dorm because the school is pretty close to home--it's only 11 miles away but due to the fact that it's in Manhattan and I live in an outer borough it takes about 1.5hrs to get there via public transportation. I also never really needed to get actual textbooks for a majority of my classes. All of this added up to me not having to pay crazy money for school. On top of it, I got a couple of scholarships. I'm so glad I have no student loans or debt to pay off after graduation.  I just never understood how people could drive themselves into debt for going to a private college or dorming when they didn't need to. While there are times I wonder what life would be like if I had gone away for college, I don't regret my decision. I have an upperhand than most college graduates financially and I'm really happy about that.  One weird thing though, I have a hold on my account right now from financial aid even though I never receive that. My coach actually emailed me about it earlier today and said I should go to bursars to fix it so I can graduate. Hopefully it's just an error in the system (which seems to happen often) but I'll find out tomorrow.  Do you have any loans/debt you're currently trying to pay off?

I live alone with my mother, my dad was an alcoholic and he left when I was 3 years old, haven't seen him since. I've changed schools a lot, which left me with no real friends, I've been bullied a lot, I stayed at home pretty much all the time. I've started drinking in my early teens. In 2011 I got into a university, chose a profession that I hated, because it would bring money. In 2013 my grandmother had a stroke and ended up going full vegetable, we had to take turns with my mom, staying up all day taking care of her, because we couldn't leave her in a hospital. Cleaning, feeding through a tube, turning her around, all that. During that time I couldn't focus on studying, especially considering that I hated the subjects in the first place. I had to find a job, which left me with little to no time. My girlfriend, the only person I was talking to at the time, broke up with me because we just couldn't spend time together. Then after two years in 2015 my grandad was diagnosed with stomach cancer. He had an operation and ended up in a similar state, so now we had two people to take care of. Grandmother was fading at a rapid pace. My mother was working too and she was losing it. One time, when we visited grandad in cancer hospital she was screaming at people, crying and then she told me that she wanted to die. I had to stay strong during all of this, which I did. They both died in a span of two weeks, during my finals. I had to run all the burial-related stuff, going back and forth between the university and the cemetery.

I make music, and every month I get paid a minimum of $20 for what I sell from distributing my songs. Well it turns out that some of those songs appeared on the Release Radar playlist of Spotify and one of them jumped from 9 plays to 1k plays in 24 hours. In 2-3 days it gained 2k more plays. This means I get paid well over $20. I currently have over 6,500 monthly listeners on Spotify.  Easter is going to be a blast because I am going to see how much I'll get paid on that day. I have no job, but I don't use music for my career. It is a hobby and a way to let people know one of the things I like to do, kind of like a culture or movement. That is why I want to get money from it.   These are the most plays I've ever received. 9 to 1k in 24 hours? Wow. I have 3 Instagram and Twitter fans each (not followers - there are well more than 3 followers). They give positive feedback on my songs. One of my Instagram fans will DJ my songs in a show.  With that being said, I've made a lot of music so I'm just going to take a break. I've made at least 3 albums in this year, and lots of EPs/singles.

I brushed it off and thought nothing of it, until it began to become an everyday occurrence. After a while this lady left. Another lady comes to the ward, then again with I'm pregnant every time she sees me. Three weeks later this lady ladie is discharged and another new lady comes and see says while I'm feeding her dinner that I am in fact pregnant. I was shocked! No word of a lie, the yogurt pudding nearly fell of the spoon with the body movement I made due to shock. I leaned in and asked this nice lady, are you talking about me? She replied, ""Yes, you. You're pregnant."" At this point, my face resembles the figure from the painting the scream. Not exactly what you want to see from the person feeding you.

When I got home I checked if I had the classic bun in the oven look (visibly pregnant) I concluded I didn't and even asked those around me if I did. They confirmed that I did not. This creeped me out even more.   This calling my pregnant happened every time the women saw me, even if they weren't under my care that shift. They were not on the ward at the time same time, did not come from the same home and did not meet previously in the hospital due to the time period. Needless to say I was baffled as all hell!   FYI: I'm not pregnant, I'm a virgin. I told my parents and my father asked if there was something I needed to tell him. I swiftly explained that I'm definitely not pregnant.

3126,"I started training to run 5 km and was confronted with the jiggliness of my body After lurking on /r/C25K (Couch To 5 Km) for a bit, I decided it was time to stop lurking and to start actively participating. I used to be in decent shape, back when I still played football (soccer) 5 times a week. In the last 4 years, however, I moved to a new city for university, I never signed up for a sports club or gym in that new city, and I have been struggling with a long-lasting depression. When you combine those things with not the healthiest of eating habits, a penchant for drinking when the depression is at its worst and not seeing the point of making changes to my lifestyle because of the depression, you get what I had become: lazy, overweight and horribly out of shape.  Lately, I have been doing better. I have been going to therapy, I stopped drinking altogether, I started to put more effort into my meals, I picked up some hobbies I had abandoned and I started to learn how to deal with my depression. Physical activity, however, was still lacking.  To change that, I joined the C25K program. Last week, I did my first trial run. I wanted to find out if the new shoes I bought were comfortable enough, figure out the right set-up for my gps-watch, and just get all of the niggly stuff out of the way so that I can make a good start with the program next week.   The first minute of running was very confrontational. I was able to finish it without too much difficulty, but I felt something I had not felt before. I jiggled. My belly jiggled. My upper legs jiggled. Even my lower back jiggled. I knew I was overweight, but I am not morbidly obese by any stretch of the imagination, and I had been telling myself that it really wasn't all that bad, but this run prooved that it is, indeed, pretty bad.  Four months ago, that realization would probably have made me quit right away, go back home, start spiralling into a depressive episode, go on a binge and feeling useless for the next week or so. But not this time. I took some rest to order my thoughts, accept what I felt, realised that I was working on what I felt at that exact moment and prepared myself for the next 60 seconds of running.   It feels good to have made this step. I know the program is going to be hard, but I feel like I can do it. Maybe not in the 9 weeks it's intended to be finished in, maybe not without setbacks, but I WILL finish it!  Have any of you made the step to get in better shape? What are some of the setbacks you encountered? And how did you overcome them?",cc,1,0.07,0.092

I've run out of resources and lies to keep me cocooned and I'm living in a very ugly reality.  I'm almost completely withdrawn from the world and have become a recluse. I still have a job somehow but I hate it and am terrible at it. Every day it causes me massive anxiety. I'm so hyper defensive and unmotivated it makes me sick.  All I'm doing is the most basic of human operations. I'm alive and that's about it. There is no pleasure, no joy, no warmth. Time has changed. I feel like I'm living the same day over and over again. Like the world has left me behind. I barely know what's going on around me and have an extremely hard time following conversations. I hunger for social interaction but have lost the limited social skillset I had. I'm afraid of nearly everyone and I feel coldness and hostility from people. I'm living in my own head nearly constantly.  Every day I'm on the edge. I have no more tricks or tactics to hide myself from myself.  The booze stopped working along with everything else.  I've created this situation myself through the years. But even if I deserve this it doesn't mean I can accept it.  I think to myself what would happen if I won 10 million dollars. And the answer is nothing would change. So what else can I do but end this? It's insane. But I'm cornered. All I can think to do is confess in a letter. To try and explain myself.

I work in a professional environment as a traveling salesman kind of gig, and I have maybe 120 coworkers over 15 locations I see face to face once or twice a month as I do my rounds. I keep it very casual with them, my rank is ""higher"" than theirs but in a different space so I see them more as equals and encourage them to see me as one too so they aren't afraid to email me or call me to make a sale.  Anyways usually I talk to the younger guys about wardrobe trips, where to find sharper looking outfits for less, to the younger girls about how to deal with and deter harassment, and to everyone about career development in general, to break the ice and develop working relationships with them. As a result, they see me as this kind of coach figure right?  I recently lost a lot of weight (25 lb in 2 months) using a diet pill prescribed by a gynecologist (I'm male), referred by a close friend who also had similar success. I'm happy with the results and experience, and when i stopped taking the pill and saw the weight stayed down, I recommended it to my closest friends. Then i told my wife ""I cant wait to tell so and so at work about it"" and she told me not to say anything about the pill, because its kind of embarrassing and like ""cheating"" so it may damage my reputation at work. She made a compelling argument for it so i agreed since nobody had asked me so far anyway.  When I began to visit my locations after my little ""transformation"" had proven permanent without the pills, at first they didnt say anything, but then they began to comment how they were all shocked and asked how I did it, specially the heavier set people obviously. I just thanked them for the compliments and said work has been so busy Ive been skipping meals almost daily, and drinking a lot of water instead of soda to avoid stomach aches. This was all true and they saw it for themselves, and casually tested me about never seeing me eat in the past, so they bought it, and said at first they didn't want to ask because they didn't want to be inappropriate, and then offered me food lol. But it feels wrong, there's at least 3 co-workers with big events coming up in the summer and they would benefit so much from this pill, but in reality we aren't friends, just aquaintances, and while I would be happy if they spread the word so others can try it and see if it works, I am indeed worried my name would piggy back on it each time it's brought up.",cc,1,0.118,0.09

I got to pursue a higher education on grants, and I can say with full confidence that my time at college has been the best years of my life. I've learned so much, experienced new things, sharpened my skills, but best of all, I've made so many friends.  Yesterday my friends and I all got together to make General Tso's Stir Fry. I brought the ingredients, but everyone else helped in their own way. Some of them helped prepare the food, others brought utensils I was missing, and everyone kept a funny conversation going. The food turned out great, and we had so many ingredients left over that we decided to do it again today. I was writing about it in my journal after we finished cleaning up, and it made me realize just how much I'm going to miss them all once we're all done with school.  I've known them all since my second year, we moved into the same quad (cluster of rooms) together, and  I've been living with them for the past 3 years. I remember my roommate for two of those years would host tabletop RPGs for us like D&D, and they were even more fun than I ever could've imagined them. And anytime one of us was in a bind, we'd all be willing to jump up and help out. They're all like family to me now.  Some people say you don't know you're in the good old days until long after they're gone.

I went over to her and did the usual ""can I help you find something"" spiel, and she started off with the usual ""no, just browsing"" thing. I said ok and told her if she needed anything, let me know. She ended up saying ok, but then started going on about how she was just looking for tv shows, she likes to collect dvds. I told her she was in the wrong aisle, and I walked her to the correct one. Then I was just being polite, and asked her what kind of shows she was looking for, and what is her favorite. She started to get really into the conversation and she was listing off all kinds of stuff, from new shows like Empire to old stuff as far back as like the original Twilight Zone. She was telling me how she doesn't have cable anymore since her husband died, she just has an antenna and loves watching all the re-runs of this or that, and also these new shows... she literally was telling me the days/times, channels, and number of episodes that come on each day for each show. Like for real, this lady is a hardcore lover of tv, especially old shows, but also several shows that surprised me when she named them. She was telling me how she sets her alarm to wake her up early specifically so she doesn't miss stuff too. Lol  Anyway, it just so happened, a few of the shows she named were ones I like too. I mentioned it, and she got really happy and we just started talking about those shows, and she said she was surprised about a few I knew too, saying she didn't think ""someone so young would even know about x, y, and z shows!"" Then she asked me if I had any suggestions, since it seems we have the same taste, so I got excited telling her about some things I had seen too. We seriously just stood there and ""compared notes"" on shows for 30 minutes. She then even went ahead and bought the complete series of one show I recommended, saying she trusted my judgement, and couldn't wait to watch it.   After that, she said she had really enjoyed talking to me, and that I had helped her a lot, then she thanked me, and she even used my name. It was nice, most people don't bother with my name or even look me in the eye, like sometimes I even wonder if people remember I'm a human being too.

For months leading up to that I had known something was wrong, but I thought it was all mental as it had been in the past. I sought out doctors and therapists while trying to hang onto the job I had only recently started at the time. Some of my issues were indeed mental, but most of it was due to a physical illness that culminated in a 109 fever and ambulance ride from one hospital to another.  In my hospital bed one morning a doctor came in and rather coldly gave me bad news regarding my health. For several months after that I was diagnosed with a host of other ailments at follow up appointments. In those months I lost my job, my home, and most of what little connection I had with my family.  Today I am healthier physically, but mentally and emotionally I have not recovered at all.  Anxiety keeps me homebound 27 days out of each month. I have no close friends. My family is more distant than ever. I turned 30 in November and I still can't work, or even go in a store without the absolute misery of social anxiety. Most of my possessions are long gone, and a guy who acted like my savior in the last several months completely cast me aside and left me with less than I had when we met. My memory has gone so dark that I barely remember the final months I spent in my own apartment before I spent 3 full days packing everything up with a body that was still frail and sickly.

This has happened to me twice, both the times I have made such a deal, it has happened.

Before taking the chance I said if it is this rare item I will take it as a sign to go an peruse my dream career. Well I got the item, I was so shocked. I thought about this for a couple of weeks afterwards but to be honest I didn't honour my side of the bargain.  Well today I was playing online poker in one of those really big tournaments that can have thousands of players. Around 1700 started, and with 180 people left I was around 145th. For reasons I don't really know I thought to myself ""If I win this thing I will take it as a sign that there is some kind of balance in the universe and I have get my shit together, I know it won't happen, but go on prove me wrong"" I already plan to get my shit together, but now not doing so makes me potentially sort of accountable to something bigger than myself.

My three young granddaughters lived with me and it was a great rural place for them to have animals and get out to play. There's a room just off the bathroom that oddly had a door that only locked from the bathroom, and one window that is just a single pane of glass, it doesn't open. I thought it was odd, it wasn't a pantry or closet, no poles for clothes, no shelves for canned foods. Just big enough for a bedroom set.  But who would want to sleep back there in case of fire?  I took the door down, I didn't want anyone locked in back there.    A couple nights ago my granddaughter's boyfriend asked to use the rest room. She showed him where it is. I heard him say ""Wait outside the door, it's spooky in here."" Then loudly, incredulously he called out, ""Oh my God!  There's a room back here where there shouldn't be a room!  THERE'S A BED IN IT!!""  I heard her tell him it's a disapointment room.  I laughed and said yeah I guess it would be disappointing to get stuck with that one.

I wouldn't say it's romantic, or sexual... I struggle to describe the feeling fully. It is almost like a bout of intense and selective sympathy/empathy?    For instance, today during my commute I was wasting time on instagram. Sometimes you get in a wormhole and click from pic to pic to profile to pic and so on. I somehow landed on this gentleman's profile. I saw just a few photos (not even of what this person looks like, just their life and the things they choose to post) and my heart was full of butterflies. It's like an instant connection/feeling of fondness that is very unique, it's not like I feel this for just anybody.    I just knew that if we ever got the chance to meet in real life, or strike up a conversation, we would have an immense connection. And without them even knowing who I am, I know that I love this person and that I feel so much empathy for their struggles and daily existense.    This isn't just an online thing, this has happened to me in real life. On the bus, at the grocery story, on an airplane. It's like I see certain people and I feel this very real connection and love in my hearts. I've never told any one of these people for two reasons because I don't want to creep anybody out. This may be something that is very real for me, but not for them, you know? I don't want to overstep any boundaries and make anybody feel uncomfortable.  Sometimes I'd just like to let them know that they are appreciated and loved.    **Some conversation starters if you'd like:**  * Does anybody else experience this?  * Am I absolutely nuts for this?   * Do you believe in love at first sight?  * Do you think it is genuinely possible for one to love a stranger?

I'm 24 and in my last year of University studying History at the moment but despite my long post I love history still and hopefully if I make it through I'll start my PGCE.   Yet when I was younger during Secondary school I used to love drawing (though I wasn't great) yet what put me off pursing it further was when I asked the art teacher if based on my drawings I could pick the art course as a option and she flat out said my art wasn't good enough to do that.   After that I just gradually lost motivation to draw which in the end was on me as I could have kept trying to improve on my own but that hit my hard at the time.  Only this year I've been trying to get back into the swing of drawing again although it's pretty awful naturally after not drawing in years and I don't have as much time to work on it.  To be honest what brought this post on was the fact that I see lots of drawing posts on different sub reddits about how they have practised over the years when they were younger and are now great which is only natural but I don't often see many posts about people who started(or restarted) late with a hobby.

It was exactly what it sounds like, a convention for books, readers, and authors. I went solo because I like getting books by myself and I figured I'd be able to see more of what I wanted to without having to appeal to someone else's tastes. It was an all right experience. I got a good amount of books, a few were signed by the authors standing there and 1 or 2 were free. As far as I know, there really weren't any big names there unless you went to the meet and greet area but when I looked at that list I didn't see anybody who I had actually read before (and only a very small handful of names I recognized despite working in a library for four years) so I didn't bother waiting in line for any of those. There were also some panels going on and I went to two, one about sci-fi and incorporating politics into the fictional worlds; it wasn't as interesting to me as I thought it was gonna be. And the other was about how much of an impact the rise in the YA subgenre is having on teens and reading and it was actually more interesting than I thought it was gonna be. I gave the day overall maybe a 7 outta 10 because I was expecting more than what I got. But that didn't put me off from never going again.  I just remembered the other day the BookCon should be coming up in June so I looked online at the list of panels and oh my goodness I'm actually overwhelmed by all the panels that seem interesting. I'm planning on going to the Saturday of the convention because all the panels I am interested fall on that day; but the problem is there are a few that fall at the same or similar times as each other and I have to choose what I am most interested in attending.  To start off, from 9-11am I have to decide if I want to attend the Sci-fi and Fantasy writing workshop or the fiction writing workshop. Both of these cost extra (but are the same price) unlike the rest of the panels and I am interested in both. I am more used to writing plain fiction and I think I would have an easier time writing samples from the prompts given there; but I also really enjoy reading sci-fi/fantasy and yet I never write it because, well a bunch of reasons. That workshop claims it'll help focus on ""how to combine mind-bending world-building with a powerful narrative drive"" (quoted from the website). So I have to figure out which I want to attend more.  Then there is a panel called When Reality is Stranger Than Fiction that is from 10:30-11:15 which interrupts both the writing workshop session but it sounds kinda cool about how thriller/mystery writers are basically competing with grasping audiences when what is going on in the news is more compelling than made up events. I think though that if I have to miss this panel for the workshops I wont be too disappointed.   The next panel that sounds interesting is from 11-11:50am and that is called Horror! Thrills! Murder! Oh My! And it is about building suspense in writing across genres. It sounds pretty cool and I'm sure I could catch most of it after the writing workshop I attend.  A few other panels go on but none that really catch my eye again until around 12:45-1:30pm where a panel that discusses world building and how to make that interesting is going on (this time with one author who I recognize but never read before). I think learning from that would be cool.   The next panel that interests me is called Magic and Power at 3:45-4:45pm has a bunch of authors that I recognize but again haven't read and it's talking about fantasy books and how magic/power affects the struggles their characters face and stuff like that.  The last panel that I am interested in is called Into the Booth: A Glimpse Into Audiobooks at 4:45-5:30pm. I've never listened to an audiobook but my real dream job has always been to be an audio engineer in a recording studio so it'll be cool to sit in on that and just learn about how recordings for books are made.   There were a few other panels that looked like they might be interesting but not enough for me to really go. This gives me a jam packed day of learning cool things about books and writing and in the down time I'll maybe have between panel sessions I can walk around the showroom floor and get books, meet authors (and hopefully this time be a bit more talkative with them, cause I had no idea what to talk about with any of them last year), and just enjoy being around other book lovers. The Sunday panels I am sure are also interesting, but when I looked at them they didn't stand out as much as all the ones I mentioned here did.  I remember one of my coworkers thought the idea of BookCon was lame but he goes to ComicCon almost every year so who is the real nerd here?

I dont know how to make it better so I figure I should just make it end. I am 99.9999% sure I have depression and have had it for a few years, you will learn why if u can be arsed to read all of this shit.   My mum has been an alcoholic since I was 10 and she drives me crazy. I am going to compile a few short stories and one relatively long story about how bad she made my life. When I was 10 ir 11 she kicked my older brother out of our house for 9 months for trying to get her to stop drinking. When I was 12 she drank far to much and was going to go commit suicide but then we ended up finding her in our back garden hiding with cuts on her wrist (she had came back from the bridge near our house, the only reason she didnt jump was her fear of water so if she was on the top of a building she would have jumped). When I was 13 on Halloween we had a little get together with my best friend and his parents at our house, she drank about 5 bottles of wine and when my dad and I where showing my friend and his family how to get home by walking she threatened to kill my younger brother (who was 11) and herself. She then proceeded to yell untill dead in the morning at my dad for nothing and then threw a bottle at his head, of course she missed but it made a large dent in the wall. The police where called and she was arrested . The next day I had a break down in music infront of everyone. Last may/ june (I was 14) she kicked my brother out again for asking if she had drank some of his rum, he didnt even care he was just wanting to know if I was lying and I had drank it or if she had (of course she had but she wouldnt say which only proofed my point). After kicking my brother out she made us move up here from the east midlands away from all my friends just because our relatives live here. On febuary 18th of this year she attempted to commit suicide by slitting her wrist, the left one, wuth a bread knife (this is the story I will go into detail on.) It was around 11.20am, I was asleep in my bedroom after a long night of binge watching breaking bad for the 3rd time as it is a masterpiece and there is nothing good on uk netflix to watch, I heard a bang on my bedroom door which could only be my mum as my dad and brother where both out walking my two dogs.  My mum yells at me through the door ""open this door or I am going to kill myself"" I wasnt taking this threat lightly as my mum had been acting up all weekend, shouting for nothing and acting really weird then crying (this wasnt normal even for her.) So I rushed to the door and took the chair from under the door handle. When I opened the door she wasnt there so I assumed she went downstairs so I rushed down to stop her. When I got down I couldnt see her and something cought my eye to the right of me next to the stairs so I looked at it. Suddenly I hear my name being called from the kitchen so I turn around and there she is, my mum standing there with blood squirting out her arm. I still think of it and I find it really hard to concentrate. It is almost like whenever it is quiet and there is nothing for me to do I see it over and over again, each time it gets scarier and scarier to me but I can't stop it.  My older brother is the best person I know. He is more my friend then brother. Even though I dont ever see him we talk about 3 times a week and share memes quite a bit more.   My younger brother is a huge cunt who is nice around .1% of the time. I dont believe in abortion but I wish he was aborted  My dad is ok, he tries to be nice and of the time he is but sometimes he can be really annoying.   At school I do well. I tend to get 6's 7's 8's and sometimes 9's which are all good/ great. I have no friends really and pretty much everyone hates me. I have one friend online called ruby but I dont know if me talking to her, and me talking to my brother is enough to stop me from killing myself. I am just in a lot of pain mentally and I just want it to stop by any means possible.   About myself. If being an introvert was a religion I would be the equivalent to Jesus. I am somehow really good with maths, science and computers and get out of the house only for school and to walk the dogs. I cut a few times a week (down from every day as I am trying to stop). I want to move to either north US or Canada when I am older if I dont die because the uk sucks.   I know my life doesnt sound that bad on paper but living it is different, it may seem all right but I bet it is just the way I have wrote about it.

It's too late in my state for an abortion. If we'd discovered the pregnancy sooner, some doctors advise women in my condition to consider termination. But it's too late. Sure, if they find something on the 20 week ultrasound that means the baby definitely won't survive I can get a medical exception to have the abortion legally but my state mandates it be done in a hospital, making it incredibly expensive and it's not covered by insurance unless waiting for my labor to naturally start would negatively impact my health. I can't go through that. I can't go to the labor and delivery section of a hospital with all those new moms giving birth around me and push out a corpse or a baby that will die.

3345,"Family/Me ruined life, nowhere to turn Sorry for this giant wall of text. I've had a terrible relationship with my family my entire life. Since I was 5 years old I was mentally and physically abused by my older brother and my stubborn father would do nothing but encourage this by getting into verbal battles with both of us because he ruined his own life. I never had anywhere to go or anythimg to do to escape this and because of that and a genetic predisposition to it I developed all sorts of mental issues like depression, severe social and general anxiety, and was recently diagnosed with ADHD. I've always been very intelligent but unable to do anything with it or focus on homework or anything really. I pretty much used books and videogames as an escape mechanism as a kid and as I grew older music and weed took their place for the most part. I graduated from high school with around a 3.0 gpa from almost all honors and ap classes and a 30 on my ACT without ever doing homework or studying in high school. I then went to college for a semester where my depression and anxiety took over and I couldn't function in my new environment and didn't have any money for textbooks or anything and after 2 weeks I slept through my science labs and automatically failed 2 classes. I began to do nothing but sit in my room and play videogames and the only time I left was to eat and I was too anxious and dumb to seek help from a counselor at school and had nobody else to turn to. My parents had moved into a tiny 2 bedroom apartment after I graduated and I had to move back in there with them. My older brother also messed up at school and I had to share a tiny room where I had to deal with him continuing to verbally abuse me and break my things every single day. The first couple months I was back I was super depressed and had literally nowhere to go and had to share a car that was always on the brink of breaking down and constantly needing repairs with my brother. After a month or so I started working full time and a bit later moved into working full time. At this point my physical health and mental health were awful and I decided I needed to take care of those things before I did anything else. I continued to work and started going to the gym and went to the doctor for mental issues for the first time at that point. I was given a myriad of different SSRI's and they all did nothing to help but I continued to try them because I wanted to give them a chance to work. I worked and wasted almost all the money I earned on things like my cell phone bill, car insurance and repairs, weed, fast food my gym membership, videogames and paying off my 10,000 dollars in student loans. It took me about a year and a half and I had paid them off. My brother went back to school a few months before then so I didn't have to deal with him at least. Nothing I ever did was good enough for my family and my father constantly got into verbal battles with me because if I wasn't working 60 hours a week I wasn't working hard enough. Obviously this had been going on my entire life and he didn't understand he just made it worse and any time I objected he would just threaten to take my things or other dumb things. I was in constant brain fog and I couldn't function. After about 2 years of dropping out of college I decided I needed to get away from this and moved into an apartment with a couple friends. I was barely able to keep up with all my bills working basically minumum wage and went even financially every month sometimes having to draw credit card debt.   I lived there for a year and although I never had any money I was happier than I'd ever been with my family and did my best to tackle my mental health issues and went to therapy a couple of times a month and tried some different medications. I also thought about what I wanted to accomplish in life before I died and tried acid 3 times with my friends which helped me discover that music is my true passion and I started making music and got a guitar. In about april of last year I needed a new car and took out a loan for 3000 dollars for one. I didn't have the money to make payments on it however. I moved back in with my parents in September 2017 and my struggles dealing with them continued. I wanted to just live here for a bit so I could save up money and go back to school.

Overall it was good, and I don’t remember ever wanting to die as a child. I dropped out of highschool and went to college, college didn’t work out it lasted a few years til I dropped out again. Now I have zero qualifications. I feel useless for society sitting at home doing absolutely nothing. Parents are divorced. I’ve never had a good healthy relationship with either of my parents. They constantly show they’re not interested in understanding my depression and I’m always arguing with them. My mental health has never been important to them. I have alot of emotional pain from the bad relationship I’ve had with my parents. I don’t feel I belong in my family because I always put emotions first, and nobody in my family does that. I feel completely out of place and lonely.   I’ve been to counselling on and off for many years and I’ve tried medication. I’m currently talking to my psychologist once a week and I constantly lie to her about the suicidal thinking because I don’t want anyone to interfere when I do it.

Actually now, with the Alzheimer’s, she might just say back “Darn right!” She’s gotten sassy these last years. I had flowers sent and the picture of her with them that my cousin sent just made my heart swell. She is my last living grandparent, two of whom I never met.  I grew up in the same house she raised her 8 children in. While my parents were working full time and going to college/grad schools in the evenings, she took care of me. I spent summer days helping sort through donations at the church thrift store that she managed. I visited her at the town lingerie store when she worked there. I kept out of the way when she hosted Reading Group, her weekly book club with all her old lady friends who took turns hosting. Pepperidge Farm cookies, coffee and tiny glasses of wine. Book talk that segued into town gossip. I loved the scent of perfume that lingered after they’d all left, and the lipstick prints left on the glasses. I also loved the leftover cookies.   I’ve been bracing myself for her passing, most seriously when she was hospitalized for the flu and pneumonia this winter. But those memories I have, and all I learned by watching her, won’t leave me, I just won’t let it.   97, way to go Nanny.

3381,"I'm 21, at the tail end of my 3rd year of college, and just switched majors this spring semester. As such, most of my classmates are 18-19 year old freshman. Which I don't have any issue with. My major change was a great decision and I'm really happy.   That being said, I've always felt young. Even though I'm 21, I don't *feel* 21. I still don't think I look like an adult. It's annoying. I think most of it is due to my height, being only 5'10. Anyway, I've gotten better at being okay with this feeling since I've hit the gym, noticed a good amount of gains, and my beard seems to get fuller and thicker every time I trim it.   But today, one of my project groups discovered I was 21. They were surprised, and rightfully so, assuming most of their classmates are 18-19 year old freshman. All of that was fine until one girl said, ""You don't look 21, no offense"" with a smile and relatively harmless giggle. But I still felt it.   Granted, it didn't sting as much as I expected it to, but I think I'm gonna remember it for awhile. If only because it's an example that shows that, maybe I do look younger than I want to look. And I've yet to have an experience that indicates I look mature, or something of that sort.   Kind of just here to vent. This happened a couple hours ago and I just keep thinking about it. Damn near texted my mom because I just NEEDED to tell someone about this. Anyway, thanks for reading! Don't mean for this post to be sad or anything, just, casually talking. :) ",cc,1,0.152,0.03

3388,"Have you ever tried to cut down on Reddit? Don’t get me wrong, I love Reddit. But, I’ve had to step back from Reddit several times in the last couple years and evaluate whether it’s a beneficial or detractive force in my life.   I like the community aspect and I’ve had some good discussions and a lot of good laughs. But at times my Reddit use has been compulsive in its frequency. I’ve gotten in many heated arguments, fallen for many fake or misrepresented news stories, witnessed many Reddit controversies, and found quite a few toxic communities. As a somewhat neurotic individual, sometimes Reddit can get rather overwhelming for me.  I’ve tried ditching Reddit several times, but I think I’ve gotten a grip on it now. Lately I’ve culled almost all news subreddits from my front page. I’ve also started listening to more podcasts and generally reduced my redditing to what I (for now) perceive to be a healthy amount. I’m arguing substantially less than I used to, and Reddit has been much less mentally and emotionally draining lately.

I could not take the pain mentally so I had to make myself feel the pain physically to atleast let it out. Throughout the rest of the year, all my thoughts were about killing myself. And then the beginning of the year, I saw a video and it had Ice Poseidon included in it, I don’t remember exactly what it was but he caught my attention. After a few vids, I saw the video of him where he cried on stream and expressed how he truly feels and god damn I have never felt connected to someone. I related to the fact that his relationship with his parents weren’t the best and he couldn’t talk to them how he feels. A video online never hit me so hard and so close to home.
